"This is my favorite German restaurant. I have eaten here at least 3 times. My favorite is the meatballs, perfectly done and very filling. I have tried meatballs at different places but nowhere is as good as this place's. Must try that out! I once took a friend who spent a year living in Germany there, and he agreed that the food here is very authentic.",5.0
The foods are not bad. The service is pretty good. The price is expensive for the type of food they serve! The place is STINKY! I spent 5 minutes in that place and came out smelling like I work there.,2.0
"I'm from Miami! And to be honest one of the TOP 5 restaurants in NYC or Brooklyn w.e.. Great stake, and well cozy it's small but nice!, and NO TVs! That was great!",5.0
"I love La Lanterna di Vittorio...Cappuccino & Fruitti di Bosco cake , caramel custard... Wine list, sandwiches etc ... Anything you order you will enjoy! My fave spot!!!",5.0
"Nori is a staple in my diet. It's one of the better sushi places in town, and it's about 2 blocks from my house...bonus. Because I like them, and because I go there frequently, it pains me to say that a lot of their standard sushi restaurant fare is just that...standard. Fish quality is very good, and I've never had anything from them that I've disliked...but I've had places I liked more. That being said, it's doubtful you'll be disappointed. Their special rolls are usually really good, though I could do without every sushi place throwing tempura crunch in every roll they make.",3.0
Found this restaurant here on yelp. Superb service and food. Very small and direct service with staff. Food is excellent and at a good price for the quality. A definite find and somewhere I would return to.,5.0
"I am incredibly disappointed with the restaurant. First of all, food was ok. The chicken liver was still my favorite dish ever, but the maialino al forno (the roast pork) was so salty that the skin was not edible. The skin was the best part of the dish. I was really disappointed. However the tiramisu gelato was also really good. But what made the restaurant lost another star is the waitress. I've dealt with the waitress before, and she was nice. Overly chatty, but still nice. I don't what is wrong with her tonight but she's the most unfriendly waitress i've ever had. So when we started, i mentioned that i wanted to get the maialino al forno. I wanted to order it first so, because i didn't see it on the menu. She went silent and gave me a ""what the hell do you want"" look. And then when we asked her which one is really good (we said that we would like something full but not to heavy), she said that it depends on your taste. Well that's an incredibly smart answer (i'm being super sarcastic)! But my patience broke when she asked how is the food and i answered the pork was too salty. She didn't speak and gave me a stare. A STARE! i haven't been stared with in a restaurant in my life. How can a waiter stare at you for saying the pork was too salty? She didn't even say anything else and just walked away. WTH? I am beyond disappointed. I think next time i will just have the chicken liver and pork belly to go and eat it peacefully at my home. PS: I even wrote ""You could be a lot friendlier"" on my bill. I think it's her period or something.",2.0
"There's not much to say here, AWESOME falafel sandwiches, and cheap! $2.50! I should note that this is not the ideal place to bring 10 people and expect to sit down, the restaurant is really small but they make the best falafels hands down.",5.0
YUM.  What else is there to say?,5.0
"Overall we had a very enjoyable brunch, although my girlfriend who is allergic to nuts found a few stray nuts in her meal, which were not among the ingredient list on the menu.  Luckily she noticed them immediately, was able to pick them out and still enjoy her meal. I suggest getting either the mango-jalapeno or habanero-pepper jack sausages along with your brunch.",3.0
"Good size portions + yummy margaritas. Salads are delicious, so is shrimp. We got the best table in the middle of the balcony area.",4.0
The place is overpriced and service was ok.   The win for this bar is the roof top.  It's nice to sit on the couches and enjoy a beer or two.,3.0
"Just ate here moments ago. The food was great, service friendly, and I got to spin the wheel after checking in on Yelp and WON SANGRIA! Bulgogi Bibimbop was delicious, asparagus is insanely delicious, and the space is great. Nice decor, rocking swing benches, ""moving"" paintings (digital). Sweet place to grab some Korean food. Maybe next time I'll try the BJ burger - kimchi on a burger... hmm.",5.0
"First the good news about this place: Burger was cooked perfectly and fries were crispy and delicious. Great service, although I could do without the dog roaming the dining room. Now the bad: They charge you $1 for cheese and $1 for onions, fried or raw. Even though I found this a bit pricey for onions, I ordered the fried. I got a slab of fried onions that was as thick as the burger itself. I don't think anyone needs this many onions. Please, charge me .50 and give me half as many next time. Then, there must have been 5 slabs of thick cheese on there which totally over-powered the burger.. Another gripe I had is that pickles were not on the topping menu. Pickles and burgers go together like peanut butter and jelly! Oh and the shakes are a rip off too, at $5 a pop. Pretty pricey for Fishtown. I think with a little work this place could become a destination, but for me it is just not there yet.",3.0
"Great pizza, great food, and good value for money.",5.0
"Definitely one of the best values in the area. $28 for 2 good sizes filets and hot stone (designed to split with another person). We Enjoy the atmosphere of the bar side rather than the dining room. Everybody in your group needs to get the sangria or any other drink is cheap (I think house wine was $3 glass). Add copious amounts of garlic butter and you'll be set. Don't wear your favorite shirt, the hot stone and butter can sizzle some grease around the table - no big deal all part of the experience :)",5.0
"Just watched a documentary: Eat This New York, from 2004. In it, the story of Moto and how it came to be is portrayed. Seeing how much effort and sweat went into creating such an amazing space made me appreciate it even more. It's clear that every inch was curated with love and skill. I've got to get back to NY!",5.0
"Went there with a mellow, non-demanding group. We were primed for a fun get-together. Unfortunately our waiter spoiled what should have been a nice evening with impatient rebukes, a raised voice, and lectures about various things, including how the restaurant could not move a chair. Very strange. Afterward we spoke with someone who purported to be an owner/manager, but their Mona Lisa smile indicated they either didn't believe us or didn't care to. That's fine. We'll take our wallets elsewhere.",1.0
"i come here every so often and has never been disappointed. some of my personal fave items: apps: string beans, mac & cheese and potato chips entrees: pot of mussels, trout milanese, my friends love the waffles & chicken special they have on wed and the braised short rib. it does get pretty loud in there but that doesn't bother me too much.  and i wish they had some sort of HH specials since their drinks are about $14 each.",4.0
"This was just what I needed --
Very pleased with the quality of the construction --
FLAT design keeps the ""bulk"" of round/snake-like extension cords --
Buy with confidence !!!

"It's a cute space. But it was so hot the night we were there. There was no breeze, and we were right next to the wide open window, and no AC. It's hard to enjoy a meal when you're sweating! The food was ok, a little overpriced though. The fried chicken was good, but it wasn't the best I ever had, or even close to it. And at $19, it should be damn good. They also ran out of sangria when we were there. THAT SUCKS! So we just shared a bottle of wine. The ceviche was good, and they make their own tortillas, which is a cute idea, but it wasn't that good.",3.0
"I have never such a great experience at any restaurant. I went with my friends for my birthday dinner. We were seated immediately. Service was very attentive and polite. We had the thalipeeth, the chicken kolhapuri and masala naan. Food was delicious. Then the restaurant gave us free dessert! The rose flavored ice cream was fantastic. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is thinking of going there.",5.0
"I've been back two times, once more for breakfast and another for dinner (and a drink). No doubt in my mind, 5 stars! (as expected)",5.0
"This is as good as it gets when it comes to pizza. I have been to over 50 pizza places and this is definitely TOP 3, hands down. There is usually a little bit of a wait, but it is well worth it. Fund old NY - style atmosphere, too. Bring your cash though, they won't take a card. I have them put extra veggies and cheese on everything and I look forward to visiting this place like a kid looks forward to Halloween. I wish that they had some light options as some of the people in my family are on low sodium or low fat diets (more salads, reduced fat cheese or pastas).  If you're looking for excellent pizza this is the cream of the crop- you can't really do better!",5.0
This is our second time here.  If you blink you will pass it.  Wednesday was Cuban day and boy was it tasty.  Very small no frills but the food is great.,4.0
"Flew thousands of miles to eat at Brian Malarky's new spot Saxon + Parole... wait, no, that's not his new spot... but it coulda fooled us. We thought we walked through space and time into a new spot for the rich hipster in San Diego... Now we're wondering which came first? Uber rich hipster in NY or uber rich hipster in SD? Ha! We know the answer... NYC of course. How could we tell? Cuz this experience came without the entitlement and small town showiness. This experience was smooth, thoughtful, and well played. Food was awesome and we're now eating edemame with lemon juice, feta, and sun drieds; what a great!",4.0
"Had a few sandwiches there- addicted immediately. Never had anything bad at Nicolo's-until today unfortunately. I called in a sausage roll, the woman at the counter said yes it had cheese.. There was no cheese (none that I could taste or see anyway) -it was basically just sausage flavored bread. Not at all what I expected. Its still a GREAT place tho-cant wait til Im in town and can go there again. I'll just never get that sausage roll/bread thing anymore.",4.0
"Wow do I love this place! Everything Tom puts together is really delicious. The tacos are great! They use authentic corn tortillas and everything is super fresh. I love the chicken tacos and the pork tacos but my favorite thing here is a Chicken and Sweet Potato burrito. They have sweet potatos so they can make vegetarian tacos and burritos but the combination of chicken and sweet potato is great. They also have specials from time to time featuring smoked brisket and fish tacos. They announce them on their facebook page. The service is always good, everyone there is friendly and it is a great neighborhood place They also do breakfast tacos and burritos which are just as delicious. The eggs, bacon, potato, are a dream come true for a breakfast meal. When I use to live near by, this was by far my go to spot in the area. Soooooo good!!!!",5.0
"I have had most things on the menu. You really can't go wrong with any of them. The wraps, pizza, and wings are all very good.",4.0
"I LOVE this place. The food and atmosphere and service was amazing. Everything I tasted was absolutely delicious with such unexpected flavors. The plating was beautiful and our waitress was attentive and sweet. It can be crowded during the dinner rush so reservations are a must at that time but wow, definitely worth it. Fun to see Bobby Flay in the kitchen too!",5.0
"A Philly find, to my mind. Well seasoned Mediterranean fare and an attentive and knowledgeable staff. Reasonably priced, if you can resist the savvy suggestions from the staff. A food bar offers respite for the single diner.",4.0
So disappointed. I've heard great things about this place but they failed to deliver. HORRIBLE customer service. The environment was dirty as were the staff. The food was ok. Never going back.,1.0
"BOYCOTT AT ALL COSTS!  $82 Steak, Tortured Animals,Small Portions 1. OVERPRICED 2. RUDE STAFF 3. THEY SERVE FOI GRASS ! What kind of sustainable eatery serves food made from tortured ducks? Really unusual. The waitress tried to push the steak on us without letting us know that it's super expensive. When I asked she rudely informed us all that it was $82! $82 for a steak? Unbelievable. $17 for a side of snap peas? Obscene ! Whats more is that you only got 5 Peas split in halves! The veggies were fresh and were the best part of the meal. The pizza was dismal as was the rest of the meals.",1.0
"Gena's = WIN.  Try it right now.  If you have a spanish-speaking friend, bring your tour guide.  It's not required but it helps. Whatever you do, make sure you try the chicken empanadas and the arroz guisado.  Que rico!",5.0
"We went for lunch today. I love the cheap lunch special and really yummy tandoori. Staff was very nice, made us feel most welcome.",5.0
"If I had to describe my ideal pizza, I'm pretty sure it would taste something like Luzzo's. The ingredients are fresh, the cheese to sauce ratio is on point, and the crust is perfectly chewy with a few obligatory crispy ""burny bits"". It's definitely some of the best pizza I've ever had. I had family in town who all wanted pizza, and this was a great place to take them as it's loud & bustling (gotta keep them comfortable in their natural environment) and not too expensive. No one was particularly starving, so the four of us shared a large and it was enough. I wasn't too impressed with the service - from the hostess to the waitress, everyone seemed to have a bit of an attitude. Our order came out incorrectly as well, but we ate it anyway and it was great enough for a four-star rating, despite the imperfections. I'll absolutely be making another visit there in the future.",4.0
"A 5-star cafe not necessarily for anything awesome in itself, but moreso for the oasis feel the place gives. I was the only customer on a day when nearby Starbucks and Stumptown were overflowing. Really friendly cashier, casual atmosphere, and great (clean!) counterspace with power for some work. And free, speedy wifi! Great place to work while other cafes are cracking down on laptop usage. My latte was good, but not great. Music could use some work, but that's about it. I'm surprised to one of only a few reviews ... go check out this place!",5.0
"Kobeyaki is my absolute favorite sushi place in the city! From their salmon volcano rolls to their spicy tuna rolls, you just can't go wrong here. They also have noodle or rice bowls with different meats and veggie options which are also amazing. The teriyaki burger is amazing, and even better are the sweet potato tempura fries. They also offer spicy mayo, wasabi mayo, teriyaki ketchup and Sriracha as sauce options for every taste preference (I prefer mixing all the sauces.) The recently opening another location in midtown which makes me very happy. Highly recommended to anyone that wants quality sushi rolls.",5.0
"Very different from Momofuku. I love both. The broth at Ippudo is a bit richer, but the ramen is equally delicious. Slightly longer wait than Momofuku I feel.",5.0
"My friend and I chose this restaurant because they have a gluten-free menu. There aren't many Italian places that serve gluten-free! We went there for lunch and had a terrific meal. The gluten-free tasted just like regular pasta. The regular pasta was mmm delicious. I had pasta with broccoli. The owner and his son were there, and were super friendly. Highly recommended.",5.0
"We're visitors to New Haven and decided to treat ourselves to a lovely meal at Union League Cafe. From beginning to end, the experience was exceptional.  The wine list is extensive, but fortunately our server knew it very well and helped us choose a great chenon blanc. The mood at lunch was relaxed. All four of our party had fish - cod and bass which were simply done, to perfection. We also enjoyed cheeses which our server selected. She listened to my tastes and delivered on them.  My Mom had the icecream which was just slightly small on size.  I don't find a place like this expensive as it stands out a long distance from the rest -- people you pay for what you get.  If we didn't live in North Carolina, then we'd be there all the time.",5.0
Great burger and be sure to grab a beer while you wait in line for a table.,4.0
"Great ambiance (lots of open air coming in when its warm) and incredible drinks + food. If you're looking to relax and just talk to whoever is around you, this is definitely an ideal location to do so. Seriously, the drink selection is impressive and the food is far from shabby. My single complaint is the lack of credit card acceptance, but when I have cash, this is where I want to spend it.",5.0
