Ive only had the pizza once I had a plane pie and it was satisfactory However Recently my boyfriend ordered the Da Mikele pizza and he said it was a 45 for a truffle pizza so we recommend that To be honest the only reason this review is getting three stars is because the pizza is very nice and yummy However this review is for the caesar salad which was lessthanlessthan satisfactory It had obviously been frozen because there was ice in it GROSS The croutons were simultaneously stale and damp Stale because they had clearly been in the freezer for a long time and damp because they had just been defrosted This made me sad as the pizza was very good However I could have gotten a cheaper and better caesar salad at the deli downstairs The dinner was 37 for a delicious large pie and a frozen and disgusting caesar salad which was 11 dollars I would recommend the pizza and probably not any salad,1
The place is cute and cozy and right in the heart of one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city Its a great place to stop in late and have a dessert and tea The staff are extremely friendly and make you feel right at home My wife and I enjoy Cluny when we are in the area,1
We found our way here in search of ceviche and left very satisfied Definitely try the ceviche obv lobster taquitos and sangria braised short ribs To top it off the service was excellent Well definitely be back,1
This place has potential The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and overall polite and helpful My husband tried the curry night buffet and seemed to enjoy most of the items Although he was skeptical initially since the entire buffet area was quite small and it didnt seem like there was much to choose from I was more keen on trying out the dosa so I ordered it from their menu We took a samosa chaat appetizer which was good For my main course I ordered the onion rava masala dosa When it came it was very soft undone and stuck to my plate The chutneys and sambar were very good though But the fact that the dosa wasnt well made ruined the entire course for me If only it were crispy I know what a good dosa is I am a South Indian and make them quite frequently for my family I believe the chef is a South Indian and therefore there is no reason why should have served it like this I appreciated the owner making her way around the tables and asking everyone how their orders were After some chit chat I subtly mentioned to her that my dosa is very soft and stuck to the plate since she asked for suggestions ways they could do better However she didnt really address the issue and rather casually thwarted off the topic She insisted a few times that we hit a like on her restaurant page in Facebook I know she wants to get the word out there but first impressions are important Overall I think I would be willing to give this place another try but probably not anytime soon The next time Im here and my dosa is actually wellmade maybe I will hit a like on their page,1
Love this place Food is yummy But Im definitely giving a chunk of my paycheck to this restaurant Lol Worth it,1
The grits and poached eggs are sooooo good Good enough to crave for days Everything here is fantastic including the service and atmosphere My husband loves the burger with egg  gets it every time,1
Very overpriced for what amounts to barely average quality food thats not particularly authentic BYOB but they dont have limes or an ice bucket Cash only is annoying The waitress dropped off the food and left without asking if we needed anything else like another knife which she scooped up from the table while clearing the appetizer plates Overall a disappointing dinner We wont be returning,1
Awseome Pizza Had the Lg with Sausage pepperoni and wild mushrooms The pizza had great flavors from the coal oven they use I have had wood fired and this compares This was second best to the Pizza i had when i was in Italy I will definately eat here again when i return to the east coast,1
I will be ordering this again The quality is good but its not really the best oneI bought this for a friend who has a small dog and she had a very large,0
One of the best pizzas Ive ever eaten So so good Need to go back asap Lines are long so I would suggest making a reservation Its also BYOB bring a bottle of wine so that you can enjoy it with the delicious pizza ,1
We were walking by ready to go home and get fast food due to the first restaurant being so busy and loud We walked by La Fourno and it caught our eye we went in and were asked if we had a reservation We did not our waiterhostess was able to squeeze us in and get us a table in 10 min The food was AMAZING The customer service was AMAZING The timeliness to get our food was alsoAMAZING It was such a family friendly atmosphere and all the wait staff and even owner were making sure we were happy with everything The bartender was one of the nicest bartenders ever Everything was perfect Its the perfect date night place We even were given hugs when we left I wish I could eat here every day,1
Perfect fit once broken in  I wear a 105 in shoes and a 105 in pants  This is the most,0
Awesome Cuban food great atmosphere and patio,1
I was very upset with their reservation policy I called the day before to make a reservation for 4 guests and was directed to email them instead Boy the manager was able to accommodate my request However we ran into some problems and informed them that we could not longer come so I CANCELLED IMMEDIATELY LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR LATER after making that reservation I DID NOT receive any confirmation on their behalf that it was confirmed or not The following day I noticed that I was being charged 100 50 off full charge for 4 guests 50person200 on my credit card so I called to question it I was informed that they knew I had cancelled then but when I asked about the charges made into my account they claimed that the moment I confirmed which again was the day before the kitchen was already preparing our food so they have to charge me AND EVEN THOUGH I CANCELLED HALF AN HOUR LATER THEY COULD NOT NO LONGER CANCEL BECAUSE AS THEY SAID THE KITCHEN WAS ALREADY PREPARING OUR FOOD THEN According to the manager regardless of the fact that I had cancelled immediately whether it be 30mins20mins OR EVEN 5 MINS he had already notified the kitchen and they started preparing from that point This was very upsetting to me not only it makes me question why our food is already being prepared the day before how come I did not receive any confirmation on their part and not get notified about these charges Im not the type to give bad reviews but this was by far the worst experience Ive had because it was completely unreasonable and unfair,1
One of my favorite brunch spots in the city A little bit of a wait never hurt anyone right You cant go wrong with their menu and the outdoor seating welcomes the cool Chelsea air while you and your friends enjoy yet another boozy brunch,1
Fantastic breakfast and awesome atmosphere Would recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious breakfast or lunch,1
Last night I came here with three friends and my dog we arrived around 730pm and left around 400am I love this place A few days ago I stumbled upon Fresh Salt and had a really delicious sandwich Speck Avocado Lettuce Tomato with really delicious chips Salt  Vinegar and a couple icecold dirtcheap beers during Happy Hour I raved about my experience so much that my friends insisted upon repeating it  There are so many factors that make it so incredibly easy to spend a lot of time here To name just a few the bartenders are really friendly the waitstaff never rushes you the prices are low the atmosphere is very comfortable and casual everybody is extremely dogfriendly and perhaps most of all there is a constant stream of random crosseyed drunkards fumbling  bumbling down the street coming from Beekmans There is no real restaurant or kitchen but the food manages to be consistently good Its just one guy that reheats things from various containers most likely made early in the morning then refrigerated throughout the day when somebody makes an order Fine by me Their meatloaf sandwich is fantastic their macaroni and cheese is great their potato salad is terrific and thats really all I need to keep me calm  cozy,1
Came for Sunday brunch The appeal of this restaurant is the chic casual country theme Loved the mason jars the bottles the pails etc The restaurant has a lot of space so its good for groups Its so great to not have to line up to get a decent meal Large portions definitely good for the men Lots of good oldfashioned country meals,1
Its been quite a while but I remember the experience was quite lovely Best thing about it was the mulled wine a huge plus for the FallWinter time Came with a group of four and we all had pleasant experiences I had the fried chicken herewhich was amazeballs The restaurant is kind of small not unlike other restaurants in this area though but make reservations and you should be good,1
Food Fresh delicious amazing even the occasional cold pizza delivery in the winter is worth it Love the da kine and a romaine salad with candied walnuts Atmosphere Warm inviting large tables Service Servers really know the food Phone people and delivery guys are always really nice Never a bad experience Sometimes its a crazy wait even for one person but its to be expected somewhere so delicious Thanks Robertas,1
Best meal ive had in a long time Creative dishes items you dont see everyday Scallops were cooked to perfection,1
the burger is much better than the fried chicken there however i liked the apps and would deff go back again to try other things on the menu the look of the place was very simple kind of loud inside but they played great music while i was eating 80s the food was tasty and the service was quick i will be back,1
Some of the best Italian food in Queens Its right near JFK so I frequent this to and from the airport Definitely worth a visit if youre in the area Try the baked clams everyone raves about them Theres no reservations so make sure you have some extra time to kill,1
the food here is really good mr fishy loved the halibut and the pig face with fried egg was darn good too didnt love the dessert the deconstructed smores was basically a just ok brownie sundae but overall a great meal im coming back,1
NOM NOM NOM There is no better way for this yelper to celebrate her birthday than a 5 star meal in one of nycs hottest speakeasy restaurant This was right up my alley We were able to get a table for two on the same day but we had to chose either 615 or 930pm The place is pretty small so I recommend making reservations at least a day in advance to get a reasonable time Like others may have said its helpful to note the actual entrance is on the side corner through the courtyard on Morton St not on actual Hudson like the address suggests When I got there I had a drink at the bar which only has about 7 seats but they fill up quickly around happy hour time it was a mix of local having an after work drink and some eating at the bar Had the hudson mule which was good refreshing and the candied ginger was a nice touch My only complaint is that when the ice started melting it got kind of watery My friend had the Calacas and it was great a little spice a good strong drink to be sipped slowly and enjoyed just how I like it My friend and I shared 4 plates so I got a good feel for the menu and everything was on point To start they brought out a little sample from the chef of quinoa in a yogurt sauce with cucumber and nuts and it was phenomenal I highly suggest they put it on the menu great for summer time Then we had the gnocchi with clams and this was great as well probably my favorite thing of the night the clams are already preshucked so you dont have to deal with the shells but it comes with this rich delicious broth and they only give you two crostinis so we had to ask for more Next we had the pork belly appetizer which was as big and as filling as an entree minus the price tag of an entree My favorite part about the pork belly was the polenta mash that was under it it wasnt your typical yellow flavorless polenta it was delicious Next was the duck and brussel sprouts side dish the only thing I would not get again was the brussel sprouts but maybe it was just a matter of preference The brussel sprouts were very finely chopped up with sundried tomatoes and in some light sauce that I found to be pretty flavorless and it made me feel like it was frozen brussel sprouts with the residual water after heating But again like I said my friend loved so I think I just prefer the more oven toasted crispy whole brussel sprout The duck was good one of the best ducks Ive had far better than macao trading co and the skin was lightly toasted I just wish the skin a tad crispier For desert we had the chocolate ganache which was very light which was ok with me because by this point I was stuffed it was like 5 little pieces of rich fudge with fresh raspberries which hit the spot The service was good attentive and the waitress was helpful in suggesting things Side note the staff was all very good looking kinda hipster The only weird thing is we didnt have one consistent waiter but instead like 6 different people that came to our table Would definitely come back especially in the summer time to eat in the courtyard Food was great and not too expensive by NYC standards Great place to wow a date or take an out of towner Best hidden gem in the city,1
I love this place The shabu shabu with the prime eye beef is very good but what really made this place memorable for me was the bibimbap I was at first skeptical about trying a bibimbap at a Japanese placeafter all bibimbap is a Korean dish and I thought the place was merely trying to make its menu more eclectic by adding this dish  I was very surprised to see how GOOD it was It was possibly the best bibimbap I have ever tasted even better than the bibimbaps I have had at any Korean restaurants I dont know what their magic ingredient is perhaps there is something with the sauce perhaps they use better vegetables or the beef is marinated better Whatever it was the bibimbap was unforgettable all the more reason to love this great restaurant,1
Best in the city I would eat here everyday if I could Great specials and you must try the kale and potato taco,1
Jose Garces does it again And this time pretty distant from his usual fare The king of Latin America is now the burger king Definitively the best burger in town Perfectly packed cooked precisely to order and affordable too The baconfoie gras burger is sure to impress but not necessarily with a 24 price tag and the regular burger being so delicious It has a great atmosphere and amazing alfresco seating too Lovely bar with one of the best whiskey lists in town Duck fries with cheddar sauce by the way are delicious This is on the very high end of fourstars but this burger just cant be beaten in town,1
Beautiful  elegantly done up in a modern theme this restaurant is a lovely experience for couples friends or the entire family The portions are decent the menu diverse and the service was excellent If youre in the city swing by,1
Gloriously crisp delicious double fried potatoes shared with 3 friends at midnight And a garlic rosemary aioli Life doesnt get much better than that,1
I got one last April and like it so well I bought another Might even get another,1
Terrific hearty Italian food in an awesome atmosphere,0
If you dont try the gravy fries at Nectars they dont let you graduate from the University of Vermont True story Ok not really But it should be The gravy fries at Nectars are so incredibly delicious My recommendation get drunk early in the day eat gravy fries Repeat,1
Come here for the Xiao Long Bao Soup Dumplings There is almost always a line to get in here You may have to share a table with another family They offer crab meat pork meat and crabpork meat dumplings I enjoy the pork meat ones a bit more Two orders of soup dumplings was enough for the four of us Each order comes with about eight I have ordered some of their other dishes in the past and was unimpressed by them Therefore I come here primarily for one thing The soup dumplings make a nice meal but they also serve as a wonderful appetizer We usually come here for appetizers then go to another restaurant around Chinatown for a full blown meal Note Cash Only,1
This place is great always packed with people always the same They have great nachosthe best around,1
I used to love the Raspberry Habernero wings but now they taste differnet im very dissapointed i dont know why this is There are very few good people in the waitstaff and sometimes ive heard yelling from the kitchen Sounds like the chef or manager back there needs a visit from the dept of labor Get a pizza they are fantastic and ask for Will to be your server,0
Went againstill love it as much as the first time and every time after,0
This is the worst food that I have ever eaten Not the worst Chinese food The worst food The buttered roll and cold coffee that they gave me in the Mineola NY jail in 1985 was better than this Once on a dare I bought and ate a chicken salad sandwich from a oneeyed ninety year old Mayan woman on a hot second class bus between Cancun and Merida Mexico In JulyThat sandwich was better than this beef chow fun Pure poison,1
Joes shanghai is soup dumpling heaven Everything else on the menu is not really worth mentioning but the dumplings make up for it You should get the pork soup dumplings and maybe a noodle dish if you need a side of some sort Ive gotten the pork and crab soup dumplings a few times but the classic pork is where its at When the dumplings comes out dont pop it all in your mouth like a fool The soup will burst out and burn your mouth Bite a tiny bit of the wrapping on the top to let the steam out and let it cool down first before eating the rest,1
I went in to try this place out I wasnt sure what to expect First the decor and atmosphere was really cool I felt very comfortable I sat at the Bar to eat only to be greeted by this Beautful redhead it was very hard to keep my eyes off of her She turned out to not only be my server but she was also the Bartender The service was great as was the conversation She seemed to really know alot about all of the different wines and creative drinks All I tried were fantastic Then came the food It was very good I tried some of the different BruschettasWOW Also some of the meats and cheeses againWOW All of the staff was very friendly alert and well knowledged about the food and drinks I highly recomend this place if not for the food You should at least go have a drink and check out that Bartender winkwink,0
My Korean food experience chiefly consists of places in Manhattan so perhaps I am missing out on some great places but BCD is my favorite spot on 32nd St for sure Of course the tofu soup is what you must get and its great,1
I must say I havent had ribs like this in a long long time The meat just freakin falls right off the bone clean and absolutely yummy The atmosphere was nice and intimate  good live jazz playing by the bar It was a bit of a wait but we were able to snatch a bar table and have a few drinks before getting seated The waiter was really friendly and accommodating especially since my friend was starving and giving the guy a hard time Im looking forward to going back and trying the rest of the menu,1
I travel to Italy a lot and am a confirmed pizzasnob but after hearing about this place had high expectations Every bit as good as the pizza I have enjoyed in Napoli It was well worth the short detour off of I95 even worth a long detour,1
Booked Parc restaurant bc of reading reviews on Yelp Good restaurant with tasty food and drink We had the smoked trout rillettes loads of flavor on crispy croutons and soft shell crabs with summer succotash sauce spicier and a bit salty but good and we would order it again I had the onion soup but couldnt finish it because with all the cheese on top it got really heavy and filling Sat at the tables out on the street and people watched It was great time great view across from the park We would go back again,1
I took over 20 people here tonight for my dinner group and the food went beyond our expectation delicious is all I heard from all members and it is not easy to please all these mouths at once My wife and mother joined the dinner so I was able to taste all 3 apps and entrees offered us Everything we had was fantastic I live close by and will definitely be back The restaurant is brand new and has a full bar and really great bar atmosphere Will be back for sure,1
I love this place Great atmosphere very service minded staff great location and killer breakfast We liked it so much that we came back for breakfast 2 days later to eat more of the lovely food The best eggs benedict I have tried and the avocado toast was awesome as well Highly recommended from me,0
Terrible customer service and food I thought I would give this place a second chance and glad I did not After waiting on the phone and having multiple calls taken during my conversation with the employee I eventually hung up I was called 40 minutes later and they wanted my credit card number I kept asking who they were and they wouldnt respond  super sketch The guy called back and lectured me and I was done with this experience I wont order pizza from this place ever again One star is way too much for this place,1
Very good ramen,1
Cheap martinis before 10pm AND they serve Yuengling One of the larger and more open LES bars and their lychee and verlaine pear martinis are great You can actually sit down and talk to your friends and hear them if you go before midnight,1
One thing I admire about New York is how the city embraces street food as integral to its culinary landscape as its abundant highly decorated Michelinrated restaurants  And among the gajillion carts spread across almost every corner the legendary Halal cart on 53rd and 6th appears to be the undisputed peoples champion  armed with its own website and over 2000 yelp reviews with a solid 45 rating Youre probably more likely to see Paris Hilton win an Oscar than see this popular cart without a line that spans at least half the block Their slogan is We are different Indeed The line was so long you would have thought Victoria Secret models were giving free blowdryers Thanks to yelp advice I steered clear of impostors from several other corners wearing the same color shirts and made my way to the SE Corner of 53rd and 6th Yes the food was worth the wait and the wait wasnt even that long Cheap and good The lamb plate was pretty fantastic Though my yellow rice was a bit of a grease fest its still cart food after all it was still very good The lamb was nice and tender as well but the star of the show was that delicious highly palatable white sauce Mix it up with the huge pile of yellow rice meat and warm pita ready and boomGOT HEEM If youre into hot the hot sauce was hotter than hades armpit Overall best 6 Ive spent in New York Dont worry about the oftrepeated tourist trap moniker Most locals Ive met rave about this cart including my colleagues who took me here for lunch satisfaction guaranteed Anyway for 6 you can afford to take that chance,1
Being allergic to both peanuts and shellfish vietnamese food is a minefield but what I can eat i LOVE This place seems very authentic The food is spicy and delicious I ordered bbq pork summer rolls split curry duck soup with my mom and lemongrass curry and coconut milk chicken Everything I ate was delicious Although they catered to my allergies the service wasnt exactly friendly,1
Extremely disappointing insulting from our initial seating when we were asked to squeeze through a tiny 7 inch gap between two tableswe are not small Even though we were seated in tables that close my wife and I had to lean over the food to try to hear each other talk over the din of hi volume music  Then it turns out that the All Day Menu is deceptively labeled being polite We were not allowed to see the All Day menu The flapjacks on the other menu were also falsely advertised as including special maple syrup they must have forgotten a few words like maple FLAVORED CORN syrup It was NOT maple syrup it was the corn syrup already on alllll tables The waitresss response was oh well thats all we have    The food was bland and warm not hot delivered after a 35 minute wait The Breakfast Burrito was advertised as having applewoodsmoked bacon  unfortunately we only got the smoke no bacon  The final travesty was yet another disappointing conversation with the waitress to explain that we were incorrectly billed at THREE TIMES the correct amount She did correct the bill A perfectly tortuous ending to a very tortuous experience A 1 rating is probably too high,0
Halal guys is good for what it is  street food But in my opinion it is a bit overrated It really isnt that much better than other halal food stands,0
I love this place The Cippolini pizza is amazing The staff was extra friendly and the location is just perfect for bikers runners etc on kelly drive If the weather is nice make sure you get a seat outside to enjoy the sun and view of the river,1
Loved everything about the Meatball Shop except for the 90 minute wait The food was DELICIOUS the atmosphere was fun and the ice cream sandwiches for dessert are an absolute must Cant wait to go back its definitely worth the wait,1
After reading all these positive reviews we came here expecting a 5 star meal Unfortunately that was not the case Some of the food was good but nothing spectacular This is a Brooklyn place trying to be a Manhattan eatery meanwhile theyre a hole in the wall with terrible service The waitress that served us acted as if she was doing us a favor the entire time and when I asked for suggestions on the menu she was of zero help Her attitude was nasty from the start we remained cordial because I didnt want anything to be done to our food Just as an FYI my husband and I dine all over the city at the best restaurants Also they have this loud rock music on the entire time you eat and the portions are ridiculously small There were a few of us our bill was close to 500 w tip she charged us a 20 tip automatically Id say we had about 1517 small plate orders to share The pork ribs were meh Ive had better a local Chinese restaurant The prawns were my favorite actually very good The foigra was good as well but very over salted and had an egg on it which made no sense The rib sliders were just OK fries were good salt and pepper shrimp  meh The burratta salad was the size of a finger portion The scallops were tasty mussels were OK Its a personal choice I didnt like the foigra broth,1
could be better,0
I love ordering from this place not once I have had any issues with delivery or the staff When I choose to pick up the pizza staff are always friendly When delivered its about 30 minutes which to me is not a problem I have tried a few places around town and Queen by far is the BEST pizza I have tasted This place is where you want to go for really good affordable pizza It is cheesy toppings are good not GREASY unlike many places I have tried the crust is not BURNT is nice and doughy and has a perfect crisp I ordered from this place at least 34 times a month and my kids love it  they leave NO pizza behind lol which is actually a compliment to QUEENS Unlike many times before they seem to get full just off the grease from other pizzas ordered from other places I am a very satisfied customer D PS Thank you queen pizza Im glad I found you ,0
Another lovely gem that bf and I accidentally stumbled upon After getting rejected by Melody Lanes AND Gentleman Farmer right next door I was ready in call it a night but we walked right past Jadis where the cute cozy space invited us in The menu is small a few salads a few small plates some paninis some appetizers We didnt know where to start to we ordered a meat platter with country pate serrano ham smoked beef fillet and duck rilletes The meat platter came with spicy mustard cornichons a small salad and BINGO a heaping side of bread large enough to feed a few small children Mmmm bread We ordered a small plate of brie goat cheese and a couple glasses of red wine to go with the meat OMG The meat was SOOOOOOOO damn good and everything we ordered went perfectly with the brie goat cheese A match made in heaven I mean how many times does a girl get to say and really mean that shes had some damn good meat Jadis definitely made it on to my crave list The most memorable was probably the duck rillette and smoked beef The platter portion was perfect for two  BF and I downed the bread of course I swear we ate a whole loaf each but whatever Im not really thinking about carbcalorie intake when scarfing down heapfuls of duck rillette which is duck meat cooked in duck fat and mashed in duck fat Like I said it was so good I didnt give a crap I happily washed down all my meat with a generous pour of pinot noir Oh yes another thing at Jadis they pour you a nice full glass of wine like less than an inch from the top of your glass More bang for your buck I must say Im dying to go back to try the duck liver mousse garlic sausage and venison terrine I really cant wait Ill dream about meat for the rest of the week and not just any kind of meat meat from Jadis,1
I like this location a lot better than the Flatiron location The flatiron location is only 3 stars The food at this location is better quality The quail egg and chorizo on toast is phenomenal here Also the foie gras which I dont believe is actually on the menu is my favorite Patatas Bravas is standard The bacon wrapped dates are better at other places however There sangria is pretty yummy as well,1
I would say its pretty ok I ordered a paneer roll but it was cold and not at all tastey Its expensive as that roll is not worth even 5 dollar,0
the ambiance here is great warmly lit with high ceilings We started with a soft pretzel presumably because it a house specialty and it was very good but its just a big pretzel I ordered a jagerschnitzel with a side of gurkensalat and Kartoffelknodel My girlfriend ordered the Rouladen with sides of Gemuse der Saison and salat The food was outstanding and Im definitely looking forward to going back and sampling more from the menu,1
So this place wasnt particularly great I went there for a friends birthday and it was the only place I could find on a Friday night that could seat 7 on short notice So I wasnt expecting anything spectacular Their food isnt particularly memorableso not bad but not great Theyre a little stingy with the bread,1
Walking into Cucina Forte about fifteen minutes early for my girls night it seemed evident that we were going to have excellent service How did I come to this conclusion I was the only person in the entire restaurant A few minutes later my friends arrived and we were asked to choose our table For the remainder of the evening we dined in privacy well sort of Everything we talked about was heard loudandclear by our server considering she was the only other person in the room Still that didnt stop our conversation from heading straight towards the gutter once a couple glasses of wine were consumed I dont think she minded considering she chimed in at various points and we discovered a shared interest in Bret Michaels Rock of Love As we were the only patrons that evening we were instructed to order anything we wanted and how we wanted it We shared a gnocchi platter to start Half was spinach with a pomodorotype sauce and the other half was cheese with a gorgonzola cream sauce Sweet Jesus If I could go back and have this dish as my entre I would Unfortunately I choose the tilapia special which sounded better than it tasted The white wine sauce lacked flavor so I squeezed some lemon to give it a muchneeded kick Still the fish was extremely bland even for tilapia and the chopped tomatoes in the sauce were mushy and lacked any taste of acidity that tomatoes usually provide There was also some sort of spice that tasted very strongly of Christmas trees Tis the season and all but pine is best in the form of trees cones or sol  Dessert was better We shared a flourless chocolate cake that was so satisfyingly rich we did not finish it Thats right four girls did not finish a single piece of cake Someone call the Guinness Book I think we have a winner We also shared the gelato in chocolate hazelnut and peanut butter flavors It was so delish I almost excused the piece of hazelnut shell that found its way into my mouth almost  Bottom line I would like to try this restaurant again but I would be pickier about my entre It seems that pasta and gnocchi rule the menu while proteins take a back seat My advice would be to choose wisely and beware the hazelnut shells,1
This place is so awesome The food is great the drinks are great and the place is so tidy and clean even the bathroom is clean Everything on the menu is great Try the Room Service Pad Thai its so good but I wish they used real pad thai noodles instead of clear noodles Also you have to get the Coconut Soup It smells funky but it tastes so good like pho soup,0
Decent sushi and good service but each persons food came out at different times making it a bit awkward for some of us to start eating before others Miso soup was much better than others I have had in the past lots of seaweed and tofu loved it Tuna roll was great shrimp tempura roll was great but the salmon tempura I could have done without,1
I had the vegetarian but added a side of pork haha and bamboo shoots Ive been exploring the ramen noodle scene in NYC and in SF Bay specifically San Mateo where there are FOUR famously top notch ramen houses and Totto is in my top 3 of all time I might have to go again tomorrow,1
Ive been meaning to come here for years and cant believe it took me this long Definitely one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn Outstanding food attentive but casual service and a charming little space Feels like you are in someones living room and the staff and patrons are unpretentious and mellow We lucked out by getting a lastminute reservation on a Friday night and there were even a couple tables open which I was shocked by The owners were very handson and the food just got better and better with the pork chop and the crispy squid as total standouts They call it tapasstyle food meant to be shared and we ordered five dishes between the two of us which was definitely enough food We wouldve been just fine with four plates Goodsized portions for the price point and not a cheap meal but worth every penny Great spot for a special occasion,1
The wait for food on an off hour was ridiculous I waited 30 minutes for two simple crepes one was a grilled cheese The entire staff didnt seem to care or even look busy when 80 of the people seated were waiting 30 minutes for their food,0
While visiting NYC we found Travalo online Reviews and menu looked good We were pleasantly seated albeit at a small table The waiter gave every indication that his interest was elsewhere He missed such basics as asking about our beverage choice After we ordered my wife noticed the specials board to which there had been no mention by our waiter Flagging the waiter my wife requested a change in her order in light of tne now seen specials My dish came before I had finished my antipasti At the same time that my wife was informed that it would be twenty minutes to prepare her dish whole fish My food started to cool and I was forced to eat while my wife sat with nothing There was no apology or general acknowledgment that anything had been amiss We did not feel special or even like the waiter was really there The kicker was after ordering coffee I was delivered an empty milk pitcher With that being said we give the atmosphere an 8 decent ambience simple yet warm The woodfired oven in the back glowing We gave the music a solid 10 we could relate The cuisine we give an nine Flavors were wonderful I had the Grilled Calamari antipasti with the Shrimp and Scallops as my entre Both were very good save the jerky delivery to the table My wife ordered the Branzino with Brazed Fennel Once on the table delicious The pistacio gelato in a chocolate shelll dusted with pistacio crumbs is a must Our experience was mixed and qualified due to the inattentive and lackluster service I would still return but would have more realistic expectations,1
Such a great place for late night eats I love the roast duck and soy sauce chicken here yummy the food is good and the service is quick things to try wonton soup salt and pepper squid beef chow fun steamed chinese broccoli with oyster sauce roast duck soy sauce chicken young chow fried rice sauteed chive flowers in garlic sauce thousand year egg with pork congee,1
LOL Ive had the same food on long united airlines flights before and that was better The chicken and shrimp tasted like pure rubber,1
Sept 2012 Context looking for lunch in Rutherford on a saturday at 3pm and reviews said good things about this place Atmosphere this is a very small place and warm It has maybe five tables for four They are cooking right on the other side of the counter so if its hot sit far away from the counter There are windows but the tables arent near them simple room with simple paper napkins and basic cheap tableware Service very friendly and welcoming the minute we walked in Looked like mom is the server dad the cook and son is sitting in the back doing homework Several tables were busy while we were there Water was brought quickly and our order was quickly taken We got our food probably ten minutes after our arrival Food the menu emphasizes to main Greek entrees the gyro and souvlaki both chicken and beef But the menu also includes Greek fast food falafel French fries hummus and some american choices like buffalo wings We stuck with the Greek and ordered the special for two which included a plate of gyro meat two pita breads cut up a big serving of tzazaki a side of potatoes rice or French fries and a large Greek salad The salad is served family style with two kalamata olives cukes feta and tomato the kind you get in the supermarket that is hard and never turns red The greens are fresh the feta good but the salad is drowning in vinegar oil dressing The gyro meat was very tasty and there is lots of it Pits were soft and slightly warm Tzazaki seemed more like sour cream then yogurt but no matter it is tasty with a bit of mint chopped up in it The surprise was the lemon potatoes which is at least two full potatos sliced into three pieces each then slowly cooked in a lemon herb oil Texture of the potatoes is firm but not hard and very tasty The French fries at another table looked good and fresh cut,1
Ive had dinner at Tandoori Bite twice now The first time was with a group of about 10 people We had no reservations but they still promptly made room for us We shared meals ie but 5 meals for the 10 of us but there was still plenty of food we were all very full when we left Additionally they gave us each a free desert We wound up feeding 10 people with quite a few appetizers for less than 100 dollars and the service was excellent The second trip was also a large group coming without reservations Again the service and the food was both very good We were celebrating a birthday so again they gave each of us instead of just the birthdaygirl a free desert I highly recommend this restaurant Amazing service they want you to come again decent food and low prices,0
Bought this to try for reducing wind noise while motorcycling  The directions were clear and the product was easy to use  I wound up using a little less than half of the mixed compound for each ear and it worked fine  The thing is they do not reduce wind noise much at all  Had much better results with the shelltype plugs like eargasm  So while the product did harden fully and form usable plugs I cannot recommend for motorcycle riding  Also tried them off the bike and in comparison to standard plugs they do not block as much sound for other activities like mowing the lawn  They are however much more comfortable than standard plugs as they do not exert as much pressure on your ear canal,1
The best pizza on Staten Island hands down Their garlic pie is the best,1
Stopped in for dinner and had a mixed green salad and seared sea scallops over succotash The salad was very fresh with a flavorful vinaigrette and the scallops were excellent I hadnt expected much and was pleasantly surprised The cocktail menu looked great although I didnt have one Service was a tad slow but very friendly,1
One of the best Pizza places in NYthe one hour wait was totally worthshould try the ice cream factory at the end of the street after this stop,0
Got 2 one never worked and the other one just wasnt as happy I was just starting to get into the computer games,0
If one more of you fart in my face or bump my table were going to fight We sat on the far left wall next to one of the bars and this 40 yr old man had some serious gas issues I swear every 10 minutes this man would just fart as if he were in his own home and let it drift right over into my space If that wasnt bad enough we were kind of on the exit route and everyone was quite large or clumsy and every single person bumped into me on their way out I felt like one of those ticker counters at the stadium with the hand held clickers that track the number of people coming into the stadium The food however was quite exceptional and is going to have me return at some point I had heard so many good things about this place from around the corner of my house and work and glad that I took the time to make an appearance Our first dish was calamari and the pieces were gigantic My friend ordered some seafood dish with lobster scallops and shrimp and I had this pork entree with bacon cheese and some other stuff I am never one to describe the food I consumed well but it was all very nice The portions and price were right on We had an appetizer an entree each and two glasses of wine and it came to a little over 100 You definitely get the tourist feel to an extent but at the same time the locals are mixed in It was the only place on restaurant row that was fully packed and had a wait  great sign,1
While strolling along the west side I stumbled across a cute little thai place I would call it sweet and petite like the name connotes simple and good Try the Yen Ta Pho if your a vegetarian most other dishes make me want to try meat but I wont hehe Excellent yuzu lemonaide very yummy to the tummy,1
Oh man this place was good and best of all 24 hours We walked in fairly late at night yet the place was still pretty full The mac and cheese was amazing the fries with truffle oil divine the red velvet cake just ridiculously good No complaints just a touch expensive but good for a nice treat,1
The best Chow Kueh Teow Ive ever had and Ive had a lot considering my dad is Indonesian What really separates this from the rest is that the ingredients have been sauteed in a very hot wok so all the flavorings have blended into the dish and you get that freshly seared taste you dont usually get when they just saute everything in a regular pan We also got spicy Thai chicken which is really Haianese chicken with a spicy sour oniony sauce on top I cant really explain the sauce reminds me of XO sauce the type that people love to use on Hong Kong style food I loooove the sauce which is why I prefer spicy Thai chicken to Haianese chicken You just need to try it and its not that spicy if at all Finished off with Chendol a Malaysian dessert I cannot describe its red kidney beans and lil pandan a type of leaf with a unique flavor flakes mixed with soft as snow shaved iced drizzled in caramelize sugar that tastes a bit like very creamy caramel  Anyhow this was one of my favorite desserts growing up and I havent had it in years but when I eat with my Indonesian father youve gotta have all the bad stuff thats oh soo good Cant say no to dad when he mentions sharing a Chendol after dinner and his eyes light up  My dad approves and so do I Ill definitely be back,1
This is the only fast food restaurants I know of in the Philadelphia area that is completely vegan Heck its one of the few vegetarian ones Thats what makes it special The food isnt mind blowing but its pretty tasty fresh and fast I like this second location much better than the original in center city because there are a lot more tables to dine in at Also parking is pretty easy to find and in some cases free  I really enjoy the buffalo chicken nuggets with sweet potato fries The texture to me is better than actual chicken in my opinion and the buffalo sauce has a nice little kick to it My favorite part is the black bean cilantro sauce that comes with the fries Its creamy and super flavorful If you love cilantro its a must The bistro bella sandwich is another item I see myself ordering again soon The marinated mushroom is topped with salty olive spread along with artichokes and onions Its fresh and not heavy at all My only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep If you get a sandwich fries and a drink youll easily be around 15 a person pretax which is a lot for fast food However when Im craving this type of food its a price Im willing to pay I would visit more often though if the prices got knocked down a bit  Stay away from most of the drinks Last time I ordered the green tea it was good but the small cup wasnt anywhere near full and it cost 250 The lemonade with carrot and ginger is very bland and also not worth the 3,1
35 stars Came here for a bite with old coworkers The bartender looked eerily familiar and when my old coworker showed up we realized we know him from his day job Awesome guy Drinks were tasty and strong Started with the guacamole which was great I actually had a huge problem scooping some onto my chip but other than that it was perfect I had the pork al pastor tacos and to be honest was a tad disappointed They were kinda dry This is a solid spot for a bite if youre in the area its small but quick Next time ill try one of their quesadillas,1
Manager was rude and condescending We ordered some whiskies and he poured not even a full shot and we were charged for an up drink which is supposed to be 15 ounces according to them When I complained he acted annoyed and then demonstrated what a shot looks like in a glass by pouring one in front of me as if I were an idiot and then just proved my point since it looked like more than wed gotten earlier He obviously does not respect his customers and doesnt mind ripping people off  Im never going back,0
Does anyone else think the Pork Buns taste like burger king original chicken sandwich except spicy and with pork Amazing My first time here definitely wont be my last Great to split the ramen with a date do not order two Had a cold tofu and avocado app that changed my life also my underpants,0
Oh Momo Sushi Shack how I wish you were in my hood Your immaculate sushi awesome waitstaff and affordable prices almost makes me want to move to Brooklynalmost,1
Food is just fantastic Love this place for lunch or dinner and their desert crepes are equally as good as the main course The restaurant is very cozy elegant but not stuffy They have a down stairs upstairs and a little bar that you can sit and wait while you have a drink The place is both romantic as it is cozy and chic It even has a fire place down stairs to add to the charm of the place Service is good but could always be a bit better  Good for familieskids but only during the day timethe evening is an all adult scene,1
Low food quality Had a pho Vietnamese noodle for lunch And half hour later my stomach is hurting badly,1
waited two hours but the pizza is truly amazing You must try it at least once,1
We stumbled on this place in the east village and loved our meal and experience Its a tiny place with incredibly delicious food The combinations of textures and tastes was just perfect and very well thoughtout Nothing is just for show or to jump on a trend  it all works perfectly Very nice staff and it was fun to share a table with some other folks A small but very well curated wine list and menu Highly recommend,1
Even in the twentyfirst century says an academic professor the history of the art world is one of the most fascinating parts of the world  The basic idea of the art world is that it is a collection of objects which are sent to the artist and distributed to the world  We call it the art world because it is a collection of objects which are sent to the artist and distributed to the world  Thats the basic idea of artBut if you want to know more about the art world youll find that it is actually not just a collection of objects but a collection of people who have been sent to the artist to teach him how to create art  They are also sent to the artist to learn how to create art  And they are also sent to the artist to learn how to create artThe art world is a collection of people who have been sent to the artist to teach him how to create art  The art world is a collection of people who have been sent to the artist to teach him how to create art  The art world is a collection of people who have been sent to the artist to teach him how to create art  The art world is a collection of people who have been sent to the artist to teach him how to create art,0
Mint Thai Cuisine is now my favorite new Thai Restaurant Went in one day had the Chicken Satay and the Massaman Curry both excellent My first experience was so good that I went back a second and 3rd fourth and now 5 times Its been great Nice friendly service and tranquil ambiance Ive been to Thailand twice so I knwo my Thai Food and Mint Thai ranks high and as far as Connecticut goes Mint Thai is the best Ive food in the state They have an awesome team in the kitchen Those guys really know what theyre doing I went there with a group fo 5 other people one day and got to try a lot of the dishes that I hadnt tried before all really good and full of the wonderful flavors of Thailand These guys excel in Fish and Curry Cookery Get and Curry or Fish dish and you cant go wrong Youve got to try the Green Papaya Salad really refreshing Most people dont know but in Thailand they make some of the best BBQ Chikcen  Fried Chicken on Earth and at Mint Thai thier BBQ Chicken is out of this world good ANd youve just got to try the BBQ Pork Awesome I love this place its my new favorite Thai Restaurant Try it youre sure to Love it too,0
Romantic little spot especially perfect in the spring or summertime out on the open terrace Reasonable prices for good food and wines and usually the portions I get are quite decent for what I pay Great for a more serious date or for taking the parents out to and hoping mom  dad pay,1
The best middle eastern food in all of Philadelphia Half grocery store and half restaurant The interior is simple with a few tables and a couple of stools right by the grill The staff always compliments my appetite because every time Im there I order a falafel bitza AND the fries which are served with grilled peppers onions and tahini I guess nobody is as greedy as me The best part about this place is the young lady at the register with the NASniggas aint shit tattoo on her cleavage lol Those of you who are complaining about their falafels being dry were probably served that way on purpose The staff here is really cool and their asshole radar is finely tuned,1
Went here with a buddy who is from Philly while visiting Amazing cheesesteak The experience was great as the man taking orders was very bossy not rude though and would shout out Next after each customer ordered I didnt want to disappoint him with my order haha Good seating outside This is a great place for getting a good Philly cheesesteak When we called for a cab to come pick us up the driver asked us if we could get him a sandwich,1
So fun and yummy,1
So good Pork Meatballs love it and it comes with bead,1
Went for lunch and it was terrific A welcome departure from the usual lunchtime fare in the area and while it was a tad more expensive I usually dont take time to sit down to table service at lunch It was well worth it the service was excellent and friendly and the food was good I had the arugula salad which i really enjoyed and the serrano ham panini which was good although a tad oily I probably would order something else next time  but the frites were delicious I will be here regularly,1
This review is only for the lounge area which nice and cozy Love the bread that they have and double like the pitcher of sangria Why order a glass when you can have a pitcher ,1
Absolutely loved the location and Atmosphere Everything was cooked perfectly from the Spam Musubi Teriyaki Burger and the house Favorite the Kula Pig Our server was super friendly and when asked whats a favorite to drink she recommend and introduced my now new favorite juice POG Passion fruit Orange and Guava juice I highly recommend this place if youre in the Williamsburg area of BrooklynNY looking for new dishes to try and if you cant afford the flight or you dont have the patients to fly to Hawaii,1
We have been coming here off and on for a few years Tonight I called ahead to watch the steelers game and bartender STEVE answered the phone Steve was accommodating and made sure we had what we needed while watching the game We had decent cheese steak spring rolls My fiance had the chile 7 out of 10 I had the Muscels too much garlic but good otherwise This place will help you with what you need based on my experience ASK FOR STEVE,1
Great fresh food friendly and funny staff memorable West Village setting  what more can you ask for Three of four of us had the special of black fettichini with shrimp asparagus and tomato It was great light homemade noodles with fresh ingredients and the perfect amount of seasoning It is a big dish one man was too full to finish it and women shared one order with no trouble The ravioli was also a hit though a much smaller portion Cash only Beer and wine only No noticeable air conditioning but a nice breeze through the open doorswindows,1
The food was vey good and the service was great They had live music which started a little late but was very entertaining We probably ordered too moch food but our favorites were the fried oyster ceviche and the tamale,1
In town for a Pearl Jam concert my buddy and I really only had one thing on our min for an early dinner Cheesesteak I had heard so much about Pats from friends and TV shows that I figured this was our best bet Located in South Philly Pats is a little corner spot and I do mean little with several tables that wrap around the building On a weekend this place will be crammed However the line moves fairly fast so dont leave discouraged Two things you can expect at Pats the most amazing cheesesteak you will ever have and second quite possibly some of the coldest service you will ever have Usually Im a stickler for that sort of thing but the steak was too damn good for me to care You MUST follow the instructions on how to order prior to approaching the window and have your money ready because they will rush you along But hey its Pats its a local treasure and a tourist hot spot so you have to at least give it a shot The cheesesteak will make it all worth it,1
Came here for Saturday lunch and they were very busy But we still got a table very fast The food here is always excellent We had the hummus appetizer which was perfect with the puffy bread that always accompanies the table though today it was a little less warm so a little disappointing We also had the chicken breast entree and the jumbo shrimp casserole The chicken breast was a good if a little dry and otherwise plain but that paste on the side makes it excellent  its a little spicy so watch out The shrimp casserole was really good and I dont even like shrimp Only three pieces of admittedly large shrimp but the melted cheese and especially the tomato sauce were the stars We kept dipping our chicken into it and pouring it over our rice Excellent flavors with plenty of onion pepper and large garlic slices I also had some coffee  it was good All told we had a really satisfying meal for 3 for 40 Not bad at all  I just wish they were a little closer to me so I could come more often,1
Im surprised to see some harsh critics bashing the Yorkside This place has been a staple on the New Haven scene for like 30 years They have one of the larger menus in the area and everything seems to be pretty fresh The portions are extremely large as well they always fill me up A lot of people in New Haven love the Italian style pizza which is understandable between Pepes Sallys and Modern its tough to compete but Yorkside has a ton of other things not just pizza Whether its the subs salads soups pastas wings etc everything is legit Shit even the ice creammilkshakes they serve are top of the line  My family has been in the restaurant business for years so I know a gem when I see one Check it out you wont be disappointed,0
love the christmas lights food is good service prompt great place for a casual date,1
Any of those who would dismiss this movie for its allegedly senseless violence or because they feel its a pale imitation of Pulp Fiction simply do not understand Mexican culture  Violence verbal or physical proliferates in Mexican culture I think many of the reviewers mostly overly sensitive gringos I would gather who are uncomfortable with this movie would probably be equally uncomfortable with the Mexican view of life inherited from the Spaniardsie the fatalism the grim resignation to the frequent ugliness and brutality of life and a sort of crude vivacity  Pienso que estas personas que no les gusta Mxico no tienen cojones  But then again most people want illusion not reality at the movies which brings up the next pointAs for the Pulp Fiction charge this movie bears about as much relation to that movie as Picasso in his early rough stage does to Andy Warhols soup cans  In Amores Perros the violence and hence the feeling is real in Pulp Fiction its trendy posing  We cringe at the gore and we giggle at the jokes then we forget the whole pop culture souffl Tarantino has served up  The people in Amores Perros are blood and gutscrude yes and occassionally ugly but theres no doubt theyre the real thing  Quentin Tarantino has never delved this deeplyI give this movie four stars instead of five because its still at times subject to a youthful impetuousness that fits the first story beautifully but not the other two  Its not quite great but its still mighty impressive  And the middle story about the model losing her leg and enduring a romantic crisis with her lover is in the end rather tiresomeits undeniably felt by the actors but it seems like tawdry bourgeois angst or an episode from a melodramatic telenovela next to the urban blight and horrors of the first and third stories,1
Dont bother with the other Turkish restaurants around here Go to this one First time I went was with a Turkish friend of mine and she essentially laughed all legitimacy out of the other ones Onces the food came I began laughing along with her Ive been back a couple times since Im not sure about the service issues that others have mentioned Ive never had an issue Theyve always been easy courteous and given me good services Eat up,1
My friend and I walked into this little italian bistro last week and we noticed two things first 1 it was loud and 2 CRAMPED as hell Honestly we almost walked out because of the lack of spacebut we didnt and actually Im pretty glad The food was pretty damn good and the few glasses of wine I had helped me forget how claustrophobic Id felt when I walked in I even looked up to notice how cute the place was decorated in a very relaxed elegant italyesque way We started out with mozzarella and tomato which we both remarked was very fresh tasted like it was right out of a garden in the back maybe We also had the risotto arancini balls as an appetizersome people had said that the cold sauce is comes with it is a weird combo but we thought this was one of the best dishes of the night and the cooler sauce complimented the warm risotto very well Thumbs up for sure My friend got the breaded chicken cutlet and I had the pasta with shrimp and vegetable Portions were large and without saying they were the most inspired dishes weve ever had this is not fine italian dining people they were satisfying at the very least  All in all the most important thing to me when Im eating out is that the food is fresh AND flavorful without being overwhelming Paprika hit the mark there and Id definitely recommend it to friends for a casual lateintheweek dinner,1
Best Chinese Food everI love their fried and white rice lo mein boneless spare ribs crab ragoons fried half chicken baby shrimps and chicken and broccoli which the broccoli is very tasteful and soft to eat I can go on and on Lets say that this is the only place I go for Chinese in the Hartford CT area I would say that there general tso chicken is mediocre,0
Reading Terminal is the best place in Philadelphia It IS Philadelphia All local purveyors tons of history and just all around awesome Great shopping great people watching and where all of the city intersects Go explore the market over and over again It is ever changing and always entertaining,1
Delicious fast and friendly are three words that I would use to describe Joses The steak tacos were made from fresh ingredients and the meat was juicy but not greasy I will have no problem going off the beaten path to return to what will probably be my favorite lunch spot,1
Nice atmosphere and lighting at night Pleasant dining  Do not get the crab cocktail unless you like catfood Cobb salad was great Service very good Would go back,1
To all the people who gave soso reviews of Cafeteriaare you out of your mindI finally got a table one night and it was sooooooooooooo worth the waitif you never do anything before you die order theMACn Cheese samplerits like tongue kissing Derek Jeterlike you died and went to Heavenmy friend had the steak sandwichit was so juicytalk about a fivenapkin sandwichwe did not have room for dessertBummerbut this lil skinny chick next to us had the waffle somethingGod I was jealousoksoits trendy and you oh so need reservationsI thinkbut trust meGOif only all cafeteria food was this great,1
My server Lauren was awesome and very helpful ordering my drink Food was okay Great atmosphere and staff was friendly,0
Ive heard nothing but great things about this place I was slightly underwhelmed by it all I was not a fan of the buckwheat crepes though All other ingredients were fine I just expected something a little less coarse than the buckwheat The ambiance was nice and the server was about average It does feel a bit blocky to move around though not many fluid paths to maneuver,1
Yes to French press coffee On to the food The Grain salad with farro lentils barley quinoa with tomato vinegar and green apple dressing was way too salty So salty that I didnt finish the blend  Grass fed steak  cage free eggs Friend said it was alright but wasnt impressed In terms of decor this place definitely is going for the wood washed airy cleanliness of a modern country kitchen Which is a peaceful thing thats for sure The food however wasnt that impressive in the end But the coffee You cant go wrong,1
Came by with a friend and order their curry puff and crab and pork dry noodles The noodles were very tasty and the sauce that came with the noodles was very good Pros  I like that they provide us with a bottle of water for us to refill ourselves so we dont have to wait for the waiter to refill our water glasses  food was tasty and arrived quickly,1
I dont get it The pizza was not only not good it was bad I dont mind the wait and rude waiters if the pizza is going to be a mind blowing experience but it was terrible Thin crust pizza with flavorless sauce and yes they use real mozzarella cheese but it had no flavor and not enough salt Tourist Trap,1
Service was excellent Decor was adorable Special cocktails were delish The food My fellow diners loved the dumplings the egg roll and the special appetizer which was squid  stuff I had the steak and eggs which was beyond I also had some of the short rib pasta which was AMAZING Love this place,1
Ate brunch with reservations on a Sunday for 1230 Front of house was great and friendly and was seated immediately Locanda Verde was packed as was the bar The tables are a little too close together but was not really a problem for me We ordered sheeps milk ricotta with honey and toasted bread and carrot bread as an app Both were delicious Loved the mellow orange flavor of the toasted bread and the honey in the ricotta We also ordered cappuccinos and I had a bloody mary Not a fan of the bloody mary have had much better but the cappuccinos were delish I had the scampi and grits and my husband had the breakfast stromboli We switched plates mid way and honestly both were very good Although the wait staff was pleasant and on the ball I felt as if the food was being pushed too quickly from the kitchen to the table I am not one that normally lingers for hours at a restaurant but would have liked a little slower pace Great decor great location great foodwill def be back,0
Went today with colleagues from work for Lunch buffet few of us were vegetarians and there were few items for vegetarian people The food was so cold and also the restaurant was cold When we went there they said our heater is not working inside temperature was 60 degree when we got there but they are not shutting down the place At least we could have gone somewhere else Food was cold only 3 items rajma dal makhni and Panner sabji for vegetarian people and everything was out of refrigerator They just put all the left over out there from the weekend Naans were all like crackers My Russian friend was making fun of the bread too She only came for the NaanThey didnt even bother making fresh Naan for us Dal Makhani was so blend tested just cream Paneer sabji was like a soup with few peaces of paneer in it I will never go back to this place and not recommend anyone else to go,0
This may be the fastest turnaround on a review Ive ever written or will ever write As I sit here at my desk completely satiated I cannot remember a more unique dining experience than with Miss Rachel First off let me tell you this woman is AMAZING Id been reading reviews and following her weekly lunch club offerings for some time always swearing Id put in my order the next week Well seeing as today was slated to be a beautiful day I thought this would be the perfect food option for a picnic in the park Little did I know this was also the one week where the lunch club was on hiatus Without realizing this however I emailed Miss Rachel to see what this weeks options were She informed me that the weekly delivers were not happening but immediate proposed that she could still cook me up something so my picnic wouldnt be a bust After a string of pleasant emails shed gone so far as to offer a complete meal sandwiches sides dessert and even drinks to make this day work I have never felt so accommodated by someone before in my life She even drove the food out to West Philly on her day off to make this happen As for the food out of this world All the vegan naysayers you dont know what youre missing And thats fine because that means more for me BBQ seitan sandwiches fresh guacamole with carrots chickpea tuna salad on celery potato salad apples and PB buckeyes  I kept reaching into the bag and the food just kept coming She even let me keep her reusable grocery bag I cant explain how satisfied I was with this meal I cant wait to become a regular customer when the lunch club starts back up hopefully next week Definitely give this woman your business you wont be disappointed Oh yea and the picnic was a huge hit with the ladyfriend Thanks for your help Rachel ,1
An incredible selection of beers and whiskeys bourbons ryes  everything liquid I was not convinced by the food though Burgers were a bit too dry shrimp sliders extremely dry the shrimp was so deep fried there was hardly anything left that resembled a shrimp and both batches of the IPA fries we got were a bit coldgreasy Old Rasputin Imperial Stout stood out with its predictable good quality  I will not order food again but will definitely grab some drinks the next time in the neighborhood For the sweettooths theres a Hungarian pastry shop on the corner,0
very aromatic coffee and delicious pineapple scone quiet and peaceful environment good for breakfast or coffee break or you just some solitudary moments simple homey decor,1
Love love loved the drinks The ownerbartender was very very nice and I hope that this business continues to grow The servers left something to be desiredmaybe it was because they thought they were done taking tables but the manager told them to serve us The rude you need to order soon because the kitchen thought we were closing aside the pickle juice back cocktails were an interesting and amazing find The food was soso but perhaps because the kitchen thought they were closing Ill come back for the drinks,1
My favorite restaurant hands down Menu changes daily and everything they offer is seasonal and fresh Ive been going here for years but am only just writing a review as Im only just now joining yelp One time I had my steak cooked incorrectly I ordered my steak medium rare and they brought it out well done They immediately told me before they put the plate down that it was overcooked and they were working on my correct steak Everyone in my group was eating and I was able to eat my sides Finally they brought out my steak and it was incredible To make it even better they told me they were removing it from the check so I got my meal free Excellent service excellent food Excellent atmosphere doesnt get any better than that,0
I cant speak to the quality of the food when dining in I can tell you my delivery experience though It came fast enough about 45 min but when it got here it left a lot to be desired The french fry box was filled with condensation and the fries were soggy and saltless plenty greasy though The buffalo chicken sandwich was dry and chewy all the way through Kinda like it had been made from previously frozen bread and chicken Could have just been the delivery prep but I probably wont order again,1
OMG the chicken here is so good and the green sauce The green sauce ahhh the green sauce Listen here people you MUST drizzle this crazy delicious sauce all over your crazy delicious chicken it really is that good  The food was so friggen good that I was picking at the left overs on the PATH ride home muahahaha Oh ya very large portions with only two of us eating we had plenty left over Order Matador Combo and sangria done and done Ambiance cozy and cute  loved it  A,1
One of the best and enjoyable meals Ive had It was a very pleasurable dining experience Not only was the food great the servicestaff seemed well trained Thats what I like to see in a restaurant Ive spent some time in the middle east Israel and Turkey and was delighted with Zahavs contemporary remix of some traditional plates from those regions,1
Had the ZawZeeg which was awesome Right in heart of the Italian market Get it to go and get a drink elsewhere as there limited along with the seating,1
Look forward to 1 generously portioned and affordable Italian tapas including fresh 1 oysters 2 extensive wine list 3 cute intimate atmosphere Contrary to fellow yelpers I actually thought the service was superb given the employees are essentially working in a closetsized wine cellar Community seating makes this a great place for small parties seeking a little stranger danger Foodwise I expected lighter and more refined flavors from the dishes No standouts worth mentioning but was overall pleased with my dining experience,1
I am somewhat of a lightweight drinker so I proceed with caution everywhere with everything But theres something about Sweet Aftons Red Lemonade that makes me the happiest not sloppiest girl in the world It doesnt stop there with the drinks Their menu leaves everyone happy with some great choices If you are in a cheese loving mood the grilled cheese works for a lighter meal but the mac  cheese is where its at The portobello burger is pretty tasty and it provides all the juiciness as their other burgers would I also love their fried pickles too Also dont skip out on brunch at this place The blueberry pancakes are lovely and so are their brunch drinks,1
Beyond Sushi should be a dream come true for vegans Vegan sushi that is so colorful and inviting that even carnivores would be tempted Granted this isnt actually sushi but we were very impressed at how well all the flavors are matched and just how delicious everything was The location itself is very small with only 3 tables and you basically pick what you would like order at the front pay and take a seat while you wait and stare at your sushi platters being made We were the girls who wanted to try every roll so we had a diffcult time choosing Finally opted for 5 rolls and also tried 3 individual pieces each They made our order pretty quickly and the presentation is just flawless We left stuffed but the good kind of stuffed since you know you basically only ate rice and vegetables Rolls  from favorite to least favorite 1 Spicy Mang My favorite because of the toasted cayenne sauce on top Slight bit of spice for me but may be spicy for some 2 The Haricat Haricot Fert is green beans people they try to sound fancy by writing that on the menu Either way it was a nice blend of carrots and green beans topped with mango and a savory sauce 3 The green Machine this one has a pop of basil and topped with jalapeno wasabi Not spicy at all which i was sad about 4 Crunch and Munch This one is topped with kiwi and sounds interesting but in the end is not very flavorful 5 The mighty mushroom This roll might be a huge hit for real mushroom fans because it was indeed really good but the flavor is just very strong if you dont love mushrooms For pieces id also say try the mango piece and the sweet pea I wish the location was bigger so you could come with bigger parties I can really see why this idea is so popular and i cant wait to come again,1
I havent had a dish here I didnt like Great service as well The buratto is a must as is the veal chop but you better be hungry,1
Heavy on the rice Not enough guac Not enough steak But I didnt want beans in my burrito Why did you put them in anyway Nice soft fresh tortilla These babies come GRANDE All in all meh Not making the trek out there again If only Philadelphia had an Bostonbased Annas Taqueria,1
The black label burger was probably one of the best burgers I have ever had At 26 its overpriced by about 1015 but its definitely worth trying at least once The Minetta burger is good as well But if you are making the trip to this place you may as well dish out the extra few dollars get the black label Great service and good cocktails too,1
Love this place  I was looking for a place to celebrate my birthday and I came across this one when I added unpretentious to the search And that was exactly what I was looking for we about 1214 people had dinner at the top floor and it felt like having dinner served at my dinning room very cozy casual and down to earth the food was very good too The middle floor the bar can get too crowded but it also has a great vibe Im coming back again and again ,1
Pizza was probably one of the worse ive had Taste like a bad quality frozen pizza Wont be ordering from them again,1
A perfect combination of everything you didnt know you needed to have in a bar but now can never live without Outdoor fires Smores Delicious warm pretzels and hotdogs Ordering beers in liters is just a bonus I hope to spend some quality time here this summer,1
Had the pleasure of dining at Sushi Yasuda on my last visit to NYC I knew I wanted to try out a sushi spot for dinner on one of the nights we were in NYC So of course I turn to Yelp for the 411 After reading such great reviews I decided Sushi Yasuda it is I called about a month in advance and made a reservation for two at the sushi bar Again my fellow Yelpers sure did not disappoint it was an awesome dining experience When we sat down the bf and I decided to go for it and try omakase here We each had about 25 pieces of sushiwowza I know that was a lot but we didnt even realized it till we got our bill Everything was quite tasty and so very fresh The only thing I realized is that I do not like octopus squid or clam raw They have such a wierd texture and a funky taste to it Thanks to this experience I now have learn to let the sushi chefs know I do not want that as part of my omakase Besides the octopus squid and clam everything else tasted wonderfully I really cant remember everything we ate but there definitely was a few items that were absolutely amazing These included the white king salmon uni hamachi toro tasmanian trout and sawani YUMs YUMs YUMs On top of this there hot sakes were super tasty and well priced Sushi Yasuda is definitely worth a try when in NYC But youll definitely have to be ready to shell out some cash Total cost for dinner for 2 peeps was about 320 definitely not cheap,1
Ok LOve this place but MRMrs OWNER I understand you are probably best and I do appreciate that But I live out of state and TRY to come to your place whenever I am near BUT really they wont take a take out order over phone even with a credit card  HUH  and tonight I call and told close at 6 well i get there at 5 30 and lady in frotn cant decide anything including crinkly fries or doodle fries just some humor hope you get so i patiently await to order my scallops and get them and walk to dining room and amabruptly not nicely told it closes at 545 so off I go to parking lot with my to go order No fork no ketchup REALLY  Doesnt take a genious to add those to take out orderTthink most people use ketchup and fork with scallops and chips Ok so not angry will come again but just some hints Know you are best and probably make lots of  but if you domnt want to be in restaurant and take out business then close that part down O by the way the cars were still pulling in at 6 maybe expand rest hours just some suggestions,0
WHY DONT WE HAVE THIS IN SF  I would be the happiest person in the world if we had a cart out here I ordered the Halal chicken and rice and it was perfect It is a big size but you should definitely order your own and drown it in white sauce  I finished my left overs the next day and it was still amazing,1
So the Monday after Hurricane Irene I grudgingly hauled my butt for a super slow 2 hour train ride to work Only to find I am one of four who showed up out of an office of 20 people My next decision Ditch work early and find a friend willing to come with me to Fish so I can have the AYCE Maryland crabs special thats from 124pm daily Place was pretty empty given the hurricane and Monday and people who had fled the city We ordered the lobster mac n cheese which was alright but not really memorable and he ordered the New England clam chowder and galley salad The chowder was a thinner consistency than were used to and the salad looked to be just a plate of lettuce But for the second time in a month I donned a bib and went to work at the pile of crabs in front of me Theyre on the small side but its all you can eat so who the hell cares except that you have to dig more They have the Old Bay seasoning which started to burn my lips towards the end of my meal Most of the crabs were cooked well but some were overcooked and full of mushy meat Sad face and into the discard bucket they go As I approached the end of my pile of crabs I was asked if I wanted another tray of crabs I really would have if I was with someone else who was doing the AYCE too but I had already been there for close to 4 hours with my friend watching me go at it So I declined Maybe another time This couple that sat down next to us in my third hour were clearly pros at crabeating They brought their own scissors and went through two piles quick Id like to try it again the next time I decide to play hooky from work,1
Its a small venue and can get crowded pretty quickly In fact it does Everyday Around 6 But the food is great Good Italian food Service was just fine and the setting was comfortable The only gripe was that it can be fairly slow sometimes,1
Pretty good Food was hot and fresh although a burger for over 20ehh probably not worth it,1
My wife and I had breakfast there this past Saturday and OMG this was Easily the ABSOLUTE WORST breakfast I have EVER had Almost scarred for life bad This place DOES NOT make fresh corned beef hash  that segment on Diners Drive Ins and Dives was for sure staged as I know corned beef out of a can and what they served was ABSOLUTELY of the canned variety The only places where you can be sure to have the real thing in New Jersey is The Mad Batter in Cape May or Colonial Diner in East Brunswick As for Hightstown Diner it was beyond disappointment we will NEVER go back there again This place is only for locals  if you have to go even 5 minutes out of your way NOT WORTH IT For anyone hoping for a great experience due to what they saw on Triple D I assure you that you will feel the same as I do,1
Fork Etc was excellent I had a pasta salad cucumber tomato salad my sister had a quesadilla and my aunt had another salad The two of them had been there for breakfast earlier that morning and liked it so much they decided to go back and bring me in tow Portions were perfect Flavors were superb The atmosphere was quaint and enjoyable Bravo Ill be back,1
Im usually pretty stingey about giving out 5 star reviews but whenever I come across a dish that makes me say holy sht  thats the best  Ive ever had its deserving For me that  in PiesnThighs was the chicken and waffles Ill admit I not a chicken and waffles connoisseur In fact Ive only had it a handful of times Amy Ruths in Harlem being my cherry buster But Im not even rating this dish as a comparison with other chicken and waffles its just really really good  The saltiness of the fried chicken and the sweetness of these waffles served with some fruit compete is fantastic Its not your traditional crispy waffle its a bit softer but trust me it just works Go order the cnw and you wont be disappointed,1
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place So much personality supercool factor great food and coffee AND they let dogs inside  I went here after a night out on the town to grab some brunch and to be honest I wasnt that jazzed because it was a vegan spot and Ive had very limited experiences with vegan joints To my surprise my garlic hummus and avocado sandwich the Greenwich was to die for The bread was fresh and soft the hummus was perfectly made and the avocado was at its perfect level of ripeness My iced coffee was also wonderful My BF decided that he wanted a ginger beer bottled and that was even amazing Ill have to go back before I leave Philly ,1
Nice garden area Came for brunch but not really a brunch place Burgers and sandwiches and some salads My crispy chicken sandwich with jalapeos was very good and my friend had the bacon egg and cheeseburger which she said was good The wine was ok her beer was ok Garden was pretty and it wasnt crowded Service seemed annoyed Arugula salad had too much dressing,1
I hate to be the naysayer but the crepes I had at my friends birthday were just not worth the 5 star reviews here let alone a 3 star review unfortunately I had the Mushrooms Swiss Cheese and Almonds and I could barely taste anything but the overwhelming cheese and the bread We also really got the upsell from the waitress repeatedly being asked to order dessert and ordering more veggies etc To be honest Ive had crepes that were 13 of the price and more delicious and satisfying Perhaps I just went on an off day but I didnt enjoy my meal whatsoever,1
Very good been more than once Love the lamb meatballs Dont think the sangria is all it is hyped up to be but everything else on the menu is delicious Definitely end your meal with the fried goat cheese with lavender infused honey it is amazing,1
I was going to write a great review about this product a while ago but kept delaying it  And its a good thing I delayed it  This hard drive lasted about 35 years  I bought it in May 2010 and it broke in December of 2013  I never used it heavily  Only used it as backup  Finally it went bad  I still have a couple of hard drives by this brand that I purchased between 6 and 10 years ago and theyre still operating,1
This review is a based on 2 recent visits The first time I stopped in for a chicken and avocado salad for takeout I asked for a very welldone chicken When I got home I saw that the chicken was not welldone as I had requested but the avocado salad was excellent as usual For the second visit I sat at the bar I had 2 different pisco drinks one with ginger ale and the other with lime They both were kind of meh The salchipapas and chicken pies were very very good though a little on the salty side But what am I squawking about It was bar food The bartender did a great job and he established a great atmosphere at the bar I plan to return for takeout because this Pio Pio is closer to my home than others and maybe next time I will get a real welldone chicken,1
This is a good neighborhood joint I wouldnt wait 45 minutes for a table but if you can be seated immediately its worth a shot The atmosphere is great the service is good and the food is tasty,1
More like 3 12 stars We came here for dinner one Friday night Pros 1 the food  we loved everything we ate 2 wine  what a relief to be able to order bottles of good wine for under 100 after dining at JeanGeorges and Le Bernardin where the wine cost more than one of our meals Cons 1 small bar area My aunt and I arrived early so they sat us at the bar directly across from a young lady having dinner at the end of the bar I felt bad for invading her space but that was where the hostess had us sit They should have let us sit at one of the tables by the window 2 Uncomfortable seating Our party of five sat in the booth across from the back of the bar The booth and chairs did not have seat cushions so after awhile I got tired of sitting on the wooden seat 3 So noisy 4 Service could have been more attentive We had to pour our own wine I really liked the food so hopefully the next time we visit Baker  Co well have a more enjoyable experience,1
With very limited exposure to Filipino food Jeepney perfectly served up a wide sampling of dishes and let me know that I need to seek it out far more often The incredible amount of people both inside and outside Jeepney on a Wednesday should have been the first tip off to its popularity but after coming in on a whim I didnt know what to expect The menu is filled with traditional dishes that range from Bone Marrow soup to fresh seafood ribs and various rice dishes With such limited knowledge and unfamiliar names of dishes we asked our waitress for a walkthrough of the menu and she provided excellent descriptions and recommendations based on our tastes Her patience and enthusiasm for the food and our first time trying it was infectious and we ended up ordering nearly everything she recommended Our meals included The Chori Burger voted one of the best in the city and theres a reason for it Coconut rice and BBQ ribs Im not always a fan of trying others dishes but found myself unable to prevent myself from digging in on my friends food We came on a Wednesday night and got to witness the magic that is Kamayan night a wildly popular eatwithyourhands feast It looked so fun that we already made plans to go back and try it with our friends I can hardly think of a more authentic and original meal than Ive had at Jeepney and I cant wait to bring more people here with me to experience it,1
I was so delighted to find a vegan friendly menu The food was amazing and so flavorful Our waiter was great he brought us samples of the soups even though we both ordered salads The check was less than 40 for two people with two entrees salads and also an order of naan The dcor is so beautiful and all of the staff is well versed on the menu and is very friendly,1
so so so cute and soft The pieces are just too small to fit in the tiny cupI had to get a larger version of the game so it is not that bigThis game is a perfect,0
This is an Fantastic book You really need to read part 1 and 2 Then read the next generation All five books are really good You will cry and laugh in this book also,1
I loved this place Its also reasonably priced I had the peektoe crab appetizer it was very good and the duck breast which I loved My girlfriend had the risotto which she liked Will definitely be going back here,1
If I could give this place a lower rating than one starI would   Sweet waiteperson but overpriced mediocre food   Arrogant chef unwilling to correct mistakes gives incredibly lame excuses for food that doesnt deliver  Totally insulted  Menu overly complicated  Few things came out of kitchen as described I would go again for a beerbut NEVER for another bite of food,1
My first time there and I loved it The guacamole and chips were very tasty As an entree I ordered the chicken enchiladas which came with rice and beans and it was so yummy The white sangria was to die for I would definitely go back and recommend this place to a friend also,1
Buddakan is one of the most popular restaurants in the city so I made reservations for my girlfriends birthday It was a dinner for 4 They served us family style but the portions are not that great Very small portions to be distributed between the four of us The food was delicious Service was quick and attentive,1
Its been a couple of weeks since we spent the night together and can I just say that I really cant stop thinking about you No one knows or loves you quite like I do Youre there to support me through group gatherings both large and small Youre there to help when I dont know what to order Youre there for me at the beginning or end of a long night out I know that I can always count on you to deliver a heavenly chickenliver baguette I can count on you to fill the empty void in Davids stomach which he so often gets And I can count on you to satisfy my late night pickle craving What weve got is real babe I cant wait till we meet again,1
Visited Ill Triangolo and had to write Top notch place in all categories Classy and old world style and the food of course amazing Im actually surprised to finally see a restaurant where everybody is in proper attire and thats the way a fineclassy restaurant should be it reminds me when we used go to restaurants when I was a little girl and wed get all get dressed up,1
Being a fan of Naruto i got a craving for some Ramen Yes I watch Naruto And what Anyway Ive been at Ippudos front door twice One I got in the other I walked away when the hostess said the wait time was over 2 hours You know you would too Thats too much time to wait The time i did go was during a weekday I was seated within 15 minutes I was with a friend and we both were impressd with the food The ambience is cool and friendly They clap and cheer when you order more noodles Im not sure what they say But whatever the point is the noodles are great and not too pricey I got the classic noodles with extra pork IT WAS GOOD when you go there remember Kaedama means more noodles But if you dont finish them its a sign of disrespect to the chef At least thats what I was told,1
Maybe this is where I should start with As much as it pains me to say this but it really kind of doesnt pain me much except for the part that I used to really like Govindas and its former vegetarian goodnessand I love vegetarian restaurantsand I used to recommend this spot to my outta town veg friendsand I cant do that anymore Well maybe it does gimme a little pang after all This review is a long time coming though after more than a few past visits that ranged from lackluster to straight up sucky Oh Ill go with the this thing Im not angry Im just disappointed Used to dig the chicken cheese steak but lately its been incredibly greasy strangely bland and simply off For those whove been wondering if the sandwiches have gotten smaller Im nodding my head yes And I could even deal with that small 8 sandwich if its contents were all that Customer service for one thing is typically sour I can ignore the nonsmileys for the most part if the food is where its supposed to be but as Ive been rambling nope You know I said sour but really on our last visit attitudes were more likefilled with contempt And thats before we got our food Hmm whats that last spice there A hint of contempt Theres no discernible line or method for ordering at Govindas most times and Im used to that Ive been there before of courseThe two 60ish yr old ladies who walked in that day though apparently had not I saw them absolutely ignored when they asked questions literally ignored Glares then backs turned to em Very uncomfortable Oy I swear if I hadnt already ordered I probably would have just left after seeing that weirdness If only I had right On our last visit the Saturday afternoon before last our last straw sandwich was the kofta ball parm sub Just fine in the past This time we were served up the near equivalent of sauce and cheese topped charcoal briquettes on a nice seeded roll Not a little burnt Black Now anyone can see that thats not how theyre supposed to look Oh or taste Inside the kofta were tasteless orange and dry They were so bad that we actually started laughing It was a rueful laugh Then my husband compared them to lookin like sundried hippo sht and we laughed for real We didnt really see the point in bringing it back complaining up a storm or whatever We just decided to finally learn our lesson for once We just really wont go back When food is really good you know how you may hear a person remark that you can taste the love in it Im thinkin that Govindas done run out of that,1
Our seven year old likes it  It does seem a bit flimsy though,1
Delicious breakfast  The atmosphere was homey and we felt almost like a regular  The staff was very welcoming and the food was great My husband and teenaged son complained of being too full a high never happens  My short stack of blueberry pancakes with Vermont maple syrup was fantastic  Great value and great atmosphere,1
This the first time returning to Barbuzzo after about 2 years I tried my luck on a week day an got two bar seats score And as expected Barbuzzo did not disappoint I can confidently say Ive tried almost everything on the menu The standouts were definitely the Sheeps Milk Ricotta Uovo Pizza Caramel Budino like eveyrone else mentioned I also enjoyed the Grilled Bronzino and the Pan Seared Brussel Sprouts A few things that I would not recommend meaning still good but not a mustget if youre not a regular is the Pig Popcorn and the Cheese Board I also did not think much of the meatballs and pasta Again everything is good here but the aforementioned are not exceptional in my opinion The interior is cramped and you will be rubbing elbows with your neighbor I recommend outdoor seating for the beautiful spring weather,1
So apparently I bought this book because I thought it was good enough The premise of the story is that the two people both with disabilities are trying to find a way to make it into a happy life,0
Dissapointing Went here for dinner with high expectationsit is a Mario Batali restaurant at the end of the day We had pasta carbonara and a special pork chop Carbonara was just okkind of plain I cook a better one And so was the pork chop Plainno sauce with the smallest ever side dish of potato cake and spinach I think for the money your are paying in this place you can find something better in this neighborhood,1
Glad to find a vietnamese restaurant close by The food is good and worth visit for a lunch Their service is a bit slow but not that bad,1
Ive been here about six times Ive had crispy citrus duck veggie dumplings pumpkin curry puff 2 beer and sampled a lot of other stuff from other plates This is my favorite Thai restaurant of 4 Ive tried around here and never been disappointed whether its busy or not Great lunch deal and be sure to order the veggie dumplings,1
Holy Hoppin Hawg sauce Daves new Wilburs Revenge BBQ sauce is really hot Good but hot At this location the service was a whole lot better than a few others We started by sharing the Southside rib tips appetizer It was enough for a meal The tips are my favorite part of pork ribs The fries were crisp and hot and the pickles were sweet and spicy Then the mains came I decided on the Ultimate BBQ cheeseburger Hands down the best burger I have had in years A half pound burger with chunks of Georgia chopped pork and 2 thick slices of grilled jalepeno bacon The wife had the Texas brisket It was moist with a great smoke ring and plenty of flavor The waiter was good without bothering us and I cant wait to have the cold leftovers tomorrow,1
well i really enjoyed Howard Stern companion blond big front LOL other then that its a very small amazing restaurant and my pallet bla bla loved there Vegas caesar place better  its interesting its cozy and u should go if u can  if u dont know someone dont worry  its only Italian food and to get a place in Vegas its not a problem ,0
Do not valet park here My brand new car was severely damage in the parking lot and the manager said he did nothing wrong The parking attendant came inside and told me that a patron hit my valet park car and was about to leave before he stopped him he changed his story when the police came The manager on site was not accepting responsibility for parking my car in a way that it would be easily damage My car is 2013 Jaguar only 3 weeks old No care was taken to safeguard my new vehicle Your vehicle is safer on the streets Dont expect the manager or staff to accept responsibility for your valet park vehicle,1
short and sweet get the pork buns and stick to the classics ramen at its best only neg get ready to wait in line for longer than it takes it consume your meal a bit on the noisy side too,0
I dont know about this placethere isnt really alot that makes it stand out from the crowdmy bf ordered an arrogant bastard beer or someething like that and I had a cosmothe atmosphere of the place is really pretty but again nothing I havent seen before,1
Amazing place to buy everything I recommended to everyone,1
I still like the food at RaymondsBUT the service is quickly approaching the horrible level You can wait 15 minutes for orders and not surprising if the food comes out cold Also the hostesses get a little confused when the place is busy I still like the place and will continue going there however I am losing the excitement Im taking my 5 stars down to 3 aAmazing Have their omelets  So good And the French toast  mmmm But you sometimes have to wait for your table for a long time I cant think of a better breakfastbrunch place in the area,1
Excellent food  Delivery Very Satisfied Will be ordering from here again,0
Ive had a lot of bad dining experiences as an out of towner in Burlington but this place might be a new favorite Good pizza fantastic service and extremely warm  a welcome relief when the temperatures are 10 and below A great place to grab dinner when in town,1
I was craving texmex food one night and decided to try this place after seeing the reviews on Yelp This place is DELICIOUS For all the people who are making a comparison to Chipotle  just because a place serves mexican food and is served in the same manner doesnt mean that theres even a comparison in the food quality I got the el tres bowl with brisket green poblano rice black beans streetcart corn roasted tomato salsa pickled onions crema cotija cheese and the roasted tomato salsanom nom nom I could literally just eat a bucket of that streetcart corn it is so freaking goodand that roasted tomato salsa holy hell  Id like to see where at Chipotle they serve anything that spicyand its not even the spiciest salsa they have Also got a side of the guac and the sangria  both were delicioso Definitely will be coming back,1
Omg the food was excellent Our waitress was very friendly and their homemade salsa was delicious,1
The pastas here are the real highlight  and I like how they change seasonally The cocktails too here are quite serious  on par with some of the other neighborhood spots like Clover Club and Battersby So if Clover Club is a bit too full for you Hunters is definitely a good fallback option for serious drinks  the bar area is pretty lively as the night progresses My one main critique is that the vibe generally is a bit too affected  its trying too hard to be Brooklyn and I dont think it really has to be This is really something minor because Im happy to have a quality spot like Hunters in my neighborhood,1
My goto for Cambodian sandwiches They have many different types of sandwiches and Ive tried several of the seafood ones All of them have been delicious most in part due to the bread I love the softness of it while it still retains the slight crunch of the crust Mix that with the pickled veggies and proteinsauce you have a great sandwich Space is tiny though so prepare to take out or be ready yourself for a bit of a squeeze,1
Been here many times My husband threw me an amazing bday party here as well Great food and excellent service Wish I could eat here everyday Favorite items are the Brussel sprouts and warm eggplant Super vegetarian friendly but great for meat eaters as well,1
Lets say youre in the mood for a nice summery beer Dogfish Head Festina Peche perhaps al fresco but still need to get a bit o work done Such was the case this week when we arrived at Tria The kind staff set us up at two tables on the sidewalk conveniently positioned next to an outlet to keep our laptops juiced Snackwise you cannot go wrong ordering the Parmesan olive oil potato chips I cant wait to return and sample more of the menu If you love to eat and drink outside Tria is an ideal spot,1
Was pleasantly surprised We meant to go to Hop next door and ended up in here instead Never have heard of the place before but it was packed all with Chinese families always a good sign All of the dishes were delicious and the soup dumplings were good Great food portions and prices But what really made it stand out among all the Chinatown choices is it actually felt clean and got an A rating and the staff were super friendly and nice  Would definitely return,1
Whats good about these dumplings is that theyre obviously handmade you can see the people working in the kitchen overstuffing these dumplings in a fresh shell and theyre very well balanced with the perfect skin texture What made me knock a star off is that theyre not better than actual homemade dumplings you make with your mom or maybe its the nostalgia factor but they are light years better than store bought If you try the pork and chive dumplings and the pancakes they have it ready for you in no time but I was waiting 1520 minutes after I placed my order for the steamed veggie dumplings and it was utterly chaotic By the time I got my pork dumplings which were sitting on the counter the whole time they got soft so I didnt get the characteristic crunchy bottom which is whats great about potstickers They were still excellent nevertheless And I know theyre trying to be fast but I was eating my dumplings on sight so the amount of trash generated for 6 dollars of dumplings was absurd I do appreciate that the condiments are watered down so you can just dump the hot sauce and dumpling sauce on top without the danger of overseasoning them,1
There are over 1000 reviews so this will be short Their falafels are usually pretty good their shawarma is alright and the line is usually out the door Its not the best place for falafel although its pretty good Its more so that its the most popular and well known place Like I said its good but not the best although try telling that to all the college students nearby none of whom will stand for that opinion,1
First time I ever went here from a suggestion of a Brazilian friendWOW food is delicious Met the owners too The place isnt over the top  like other restaurants  but what matters is the FOOD Its Brazilian not Portugueseand Its a buffet style but cooked fresh  the kitchen is right in front of you I also went in there with a bottle of Pinor Noir its a BYOB establishment And we enjoyed the atmosphere Very accommodating It was a little too bright in there and its nothing fancy but you will go back for the food definitely I will definitely go back and tell my friends about this place I saved the directions in my GPS  its that good,1
5 years and countless meals later I still agree with my review from 2009 If anything Peaches has improved with age The menu has stuck to the solid options pry the turkey meatloaf from my cold dead hands and has updated frequently enough to stay fresh  Brunch lunch and dinner are all excellent Keep in mind the neighborhood is still working on building up more options and Peaches has a solid reputation so youll probably have a wait Sunday brunch as church lets out Forget about it If you are a party of one or two try to grab a spot at the gorgeous bar,1
Was planning to go there for a long time Ive been living in that neighbourhood for almost a decade  Just as I was toldIt was crowded as anticipated but got a table for 5 fairly quickly  15 mins The food choices were pretty good and the prices were a steal The service was quick and good too despite the crowd Will need to visit more often,1
Really disappointed in service Discovered this cute bar after seeing a show in town great atmosphere  wish I could give a review of the food but the service was seriously lacking  Took seats at the bar  took bar tender who was really busy polishing glasses  talking to finally acknowledge us  once he did get us A menu  took our drink order we started looking at food menu that he gave us as he gave us our drinks we asked for appetizers  he said oh our kitchen is closed he had just put serving plates down for the couple next to us no apology or anything We sat  watched food eventually come out to people around us  Dont most places let you know AS they hand you menus that the kitchen is closing soon We left hungry  annoyed Food looked great but will never go back,1
This movie was my wifes go to movie  We loved it  Its been one of my favorite movies  I am a big fan of Treme  I love this movie  Its a good movieI cant imagine what this movie would have been like if it had been released on DVD I cant imagine the level of emotion that would have been conveyed Its about a group of people who go on a long journey to find a better life for themselves and their family The movie has a lot of action and it has great action There is a lot of blood and guts that are going on Its great that the movie is made in the USA and the actors are,0
im all for good date bars but this place is too loud music wise too dark and not cozy enough seatings also its wine and beers only,1
Absolutely delectable Stumbled upon this place while searching for a local restaurant with some friends To start off the atmosphere was really amiable and the waiters were more than friendly I think we even got served by one of the chefs Make sure to go early or make a reservation as the place fills up quickly Now on to the food Appetizers We ordered the Mussels Africana which were really nicely flavored It was a little spicy as a word of caution they dont indicate on the menu whether certain dishes are spicy so you will have to find out for yourself At the end quite delicious Entrees I ordered the stuffed filet which was basically a flounder stuffed with crabmeat on top of a bed of spinach and some fingerling potatoes The fish almost melted in my mouth I wish the dish was a little less salty though which was the only minus I had to drink a lot of water My friends both got a chicken dish which was also very tender and wellprepared Dessert We shared a tiramisu cake It tasted really fresh with a strong coffee taste Loved it One of the best tiramisu Ive had The place is a little pricey though but if you are looking to go somewhere with a nice atmosphere quick service friendly atmosphere and good food this is the place to go,1
Took the wife here last night for an anniversary dinner Overall I would highly recommend this place for dinner  Well certainly be back at some point and will bring friends Its small so I would imagine you def wanna make a reso for FriSat nights The drink menu is broad and theres some different stuff on there which is nice Same thing for the dinner menu  We liked the variety and the fact that it wasnt the same old stuff on the menu For apps we had the Lobster Cobb salad and Tuna Tartar  Both were excellent  Cant go back without getting the Lobster Cobb salad  thats a real winner  For dinner I had the Rib Eye and the wife had the Skate Wing which is a fish specifically Stingray Both entrees were excellent I loved how the Rib Eye was prepared and served it was sliced up which was a nice change  I got the Cippoloini as a side which went really well with the Rib Eye  the wife really enjoyed the Skate Wing with the risotto  She loved it For dessert gotta have the dirt tasting  Its relatively small which is nice cuz u dont feel gorged when you leave but it will satisfy the postdinner sweet tooth  Nice new place for something different if you are looking for that   I recommend it,0
Very nice ambiance for a Thai restaurant Upscale I had the lunch special and the portions were big at least it was a very good value I also ordered the fish cakes which were tasty,1
Brisket sandwich with a side of beans Delicious,1
Love this place Goto,1
The restaurant is really disappointing The pasta dishes are just ok The pizza actually came burned when I ate in the restaurant Guess they dont pay too much attention to dine in Come for pizza but not at the restaurant,1
They work very well on my Macbook Pro  I also love that its been powered by a 6v power supply  I also like the fact that the micro USB port is,0
Queens Kickshaw is a caf Or is it a bar Or is it a restaurant that has a somewhat unhealthy obsession with grilled cheese sandwiches It is all of these things which makes it awesome on one hand and a little confused on the other I think I am going to go with bar since I am in love with their expansive microbrew menu Kickshaw is also a place where I want and have spent many a late Saturday afternoon sitting on a reclaimed wooden bench by the lofty windows gnawing at the pickle plate sipping a hoppy beer and watching the world of Astoria go by Grilled cheese sandwiches alone are alright Maybe grilled cheese isnt my thing  alone at least The problem with the menu is that it is a bit limited  its snacklike not fit for a meal In the same vein a rich and indulgent grilled cheese needs to be balanced by a light soup or salad or seasonal vegetable or something Just a suggestion to the folks at TQK add a veggie centric sides menu and youll be golden Service can also be a little hit or miss which would be fine for a bar but not so much for a place with one foot in restaurantland,1
Wost tacos Ive had in upper west side Last night I ordered five carne assada tacos and one korean taco and rice and beans Instead of carne asada I got dry shredded beef the beans included were black beans not pinto which is typical of most mexican places Ive eaten at Totally wrong Ive officially given up on getting good tacos in the city I guess Im going to have to resort to going out to the reliably good places I know in bk and queens if I want good mexican Additionally they havent updated their website and the prices were higher than listed there Im from southern cali and while I know so cal mexican isnt authentic mexican its a hell of a lot better than this phoney place Dont wast your time with this place especially if youve tried good mexican food and know the difference,0
I have another one of these on the market and it is a nice light for the priceGreat product Great price I am using it in the shop to cover a lot of metal It is still going strong I am very pleasedI bought this to replace a broken one I had  I love the color and the fact that the hose is a little longer than I expected  This one has a nice white finish  I like that the hose is longer than the one I had  The hose has a small rubber ring that helps keep it clean  I am really pleased,0
Cafe Renata keeps getting better and better Today it was open on Labor Day and my brother and I got few mimosas I drank so many cups of coffee I feel excellent Waffle Ranchero was really good Fruit parfait was really coconuty Wait service is great and the updatesrenovations to the interior is SO BEAUTIFUL I love sitting in there The wood is really pretty You can order at the counter or have a waiter They play really nice music On those rare days when youre tired of living in trash and old rotting things Cafe Renata makes you feel like youre on vacation from Philadelphia Also bitchy people who write negatives yelp reviews are so entitled  Why dont they open a restaurant And cook and clean and endlessly answer the same questions over and over while trying to be polite Get real,1
Great food if quite greasy although that could just have been the dishes I ordered It was crowded and there was a bit of a wait but we were able to be seated at the counter Not the most comfortable seating situation but it was fine Might have to go back again and try some other dishes,1
Classic New York diner with an excellent breakfast It was entirely packed with an early crowd Prices were very reasonable,1
This is one of those local places that you go because it is an easy laidback kind of place Everyone is really nice no one rushes you out and more importantly everything is always good  The food is always fresh One key element is that they bake their own pitas and make their own hummus The chicken wrap falafels and pizza are my personal favorites The prices are good But please note this is not FAST food So dont go in there thinking youll be out in a couple of minutes Everything is made to order so please go when you have the time to enjoy it,1
Service  ambiance was awesome I had wished that I asked for our servers name so I could personally mention her here She was so helpful timely polite and pleasant Actually every staff member that we came in contact with was genuine and helpful Food was fresh and awesome Best burger Drink was fabulous Prices were perfect Keep it up,1
excellent brunch spot met a friend who was visiting from miami who i havent seen in years here for brunch we decided to sit at the bar even though we had a reservation to give ourselves some more room and to make sure we wouldnt be rushed so we could catchup over a leisurely meal the bartender was lovely and attentive  sorry i did not catch his name we ordered bloody marys strong and spicy he definitely listened they were strong and delicious also tried some beers on tap  nice selection liked the amber the best as well as the caroline cocktail for brunch we ordered a bread basket to start ill come back to thisOMFG the kale and escarole salad with chicken and the heritage pork and eggs ok the bread basket with the marmalade fresh whipped butter and apple butter were to die for you get a currant scone fresh delicious and buttery carrot breadcake great crust and an apple muffin the apple muffin was the best delicious and soft on the inside with big chunks of fresh apple do yall sell the apple muffins on their own if not YOU SHOULD the kaleescarolechickensoft egg salad was really nice good portion and dressed evenly and lightly my friend loved the pork and eggs could definitely tell the pork came from a pig just a few days ago that poor pigglet but really enjoyed it and was refreshingly surprised at the difference in taste between the heritage pork and other pork he has had in the past would definitely go back and recommend to others looking for a great experience food and farmtotable experience they really live up to the famtotable name,1
stop everything nom nom nom NOM SO DELICIOUS how do they not run out of spinach wraps holy mother of olive oil Cant wait to go back and try some yogurt and desserts so I can give this place another star PS the yelp deal was a stealThe amount of food you can get for the offer can feed a family Ran into this place after an accidental mixup one of the best mistakes I have ever made,1
Reasonly priced good atmosphere with young lively crowd Fries were good Had the chicken mussels and avacado salad Good food at reasonable price Bill was 72,1
The food ranges from OK to superb Avoid the pork and beef options and steer towards seafood options The sashimi platter is always a great option The dessert options here are also very nice The decor is nice but the service is lacking for such a nice japanese restaurant The staff can be abrupt and lackadaisical compared to your traditional japanese restaurant Which is unfortunate because otherwise I would feel like I was transported to Japan every time I come to this place,0
Went here for wifes birthday attentive service exceptional foodwe are vegetarian and were well catered to Like the A La Carte option Apart from complimentary birthday cake they gave small pound cake to take home on the way out Would defi recommend,1
Just got an order from them and although this may sound petty it pisses me off We got 2 pizzas mediocre as with all pizza in the areathats another story and an order of chicken fingers appetizer The order of chicken fingers was 795 and while they were OK there were only 3 of them And about 10  12 steak fries I called to ask if there was a mistake and was told that was the normal portion size 3 premade fingers and some steak fries Not that we wanted to eat 20 of them but most places give you at least 5 or so My daughter had two friends over and they were so disappointed  they wanted more than one each And it didnt cross my mind to ask how many come in an order either as its a given there are more than 3 And the pizza is marginal at best and I absolutely loathe when pizza places dump oregano on top of the cheese rather than in the sauce where it belongs They use way too much To be fair I have yet to have any pizza in Morris County besides Nonnas when they first opened their pizza has gone downhill as well that has been amazing  The Godfather should be ashamed of themselves for charging 8 for 3 frozen chicken fingers and a handful of fries If they were 3 home made the best tasting chicken fingers I ever ate this wouldnt be an issue But when you order chicken fingers you usually expect the kind that we got which is fine for an appetizer but you usually get more than 3  crosses the Godfather off her list of pizza places,1
Its was interesting to see what happens when the two families decide to work together to fix their problemsI liked the way the characters developed and the depth of the story The story line was well written and kept me engaged The characters are well developed and the characters are well developed The story is a quick and easy readI have loved every,0
A bartender was cleaning up at the bar and accidentally threw hot water at me and my boyfriend it got me in the eye and got my coat all wet and soaked my boyfriends shirt when i said to him woah you just hit us he said condescendingly oh is that right smirked and walked away it was pretty shocking the bartender that served us was alright but his douchebag coworker needs to get thrown hot water at,1
Whats the point of all you can eat pasta if the pasta isnt very good Everyone seems to love this concept of all you can eat food but honestly there is a reason its all you can eat Its not great food The waiters here are pushy salesmen I didnt like that I wanted a nice meal after the theater not a enitre sales presentation of everything on the menu The salads were blah the barruta cheese wasnt fresh and while I love the idea of a 25 bottle wine menu I dont like it when they unscrew the cap off the bottle Tacky No value in selling a 6 bottle of wine at 25,1
I took my mother here and she was super happy nuff said But to say something else the food is reasonable and yummy  although Im not sure it would satiate a raging hunger Most stuff including the mozarella is made on site and the deep fried pizzas are insane and delicious I have had one bad glass of wine from here  but this was rectified on a second visit Considering they only serve wine I imagine its a rare occurrence that they get it wrong,0
The challah French toast with rum maple syrup candied walnuts and pear is phenomenal I finished the whole thing and it was so good Prices are reasonable for the large portions and service was prompt and friendly We went on a Friday morning Seems like weekends could get busy since its a small space,1
Love the cheeseburgers here Try one,0
While the waiter was friendly and efficient something has gone wrong with this restaurant since we first started coming here  We ordered deviled eggs and shrimp cocktail for appetizers The deviled eggs had no seasoning it was as if someone had just put the plain yolk back in the egg without any vinegar salt pepper mayo The shrimp looked great but were tasteless as well  My husband ordered a burger with a fried egg and cheese Egg was missing  My flatbread pizza Where do I begin I ordered the one with frisee lettuce and poached egg The expectation was a crispy flatbread with fluffy lettuce cheese and bacon and egg on top Clearly my order waited under a heat lamp for a long time since a the lettuce was wilted in fact it looked spoiled b the flatbread was so old it was flabby limp and flacid Worse it was stuck to the plate  Will not go here again Take a pass and head toward New Haven,1
Maybe its because I saw Julie and Julia beforehand but I didnt think it was anything special The steak au poivre was just ok I ordered it medium rare and it came in a dull grayso cooked way ahead of time and just reheated We were there at 6so why wasnt it cooked to order Beet salad was decent Fries were warm Service was ok Eh,1
This review is strictly for the family style Bo Ssam So I came here with a group of 7 1 which happened to be newly vegetarian so basically there was 6 of us eating this The food is very plentiful they basically give you a half of carcass of meat Along with your huge slab of slowly cooked pork you get a bowl of bibb lettuce 2 kimchi infused sauces 1 green onion oil sauce and 1 hot sauce You also get some oysters and a bowl of rice The flavors are rich and delicious But here is my main gripe about this bo ssam feast Its basically the same thing as eating a huge bowl of Fettuccine Alfredo about half way through you find yourself completely sick of the same rich and heavy flavor I know the bo ssam is meant for 610 ppl but i would say go with about 15 ppl if thats allowed Enjoy some of the bo ssam and mix it up with some variety by ordering some a la carte dishes I felt a little bit sick from all the richness of the pork You cant eat too much of it though because after a while youve just had enough of the same repeating flavors All in all it was good but I definitely left feeling like I did not eat 50 worth of food,1
Banana burger The first time Ive ever tasted something like this The meat patty drowned in all the extra stuff lettuce tomato mayo corn perfectly cooked sweet plantains between two soft flaky buns It was kind of a mess but it tasted really amazing Devoured in minutes Cheap prices and a lot of other types of burgers and Brazilian foods Tried the sweet Pomonha and that was corn heaven  The place is smallcozy They should expand The service was very friendly also Def coming back for more,1
I think this place is overrated I dont understand why its always packed Their avocado toast was good but I didnt think their couscous was amazing like everyone says I rather go across the street and go to cafe habana any day,1
One of the best meals Ive had in the city so far Came here for dinner and it was great  Food  we tried the Smoked Salmon Galette Black Label Burger and the Pasta Za Za All were DELICIOUS The portions were pretty big and very filling In terms of pricing 28 definitely seems like a lot for a burger but it was cooked perfectly and came with a huge mound of fries  Service  in general the service was good Our waiter seemed less than enthusiastic but he was attentive and came by often to check on us  Atmosphere  the place is pretty big with tables right next to the bar in the entrance and a bigger seating area in the back For dinner the lighting was very dimly lit a nice spot for a intimate dinner but it also felt like there was a lot going on so it wasnt quiet Overall Great food Definitely a must try especially if youre a burger connoisseur,1
I randomly walked by this brand new family owned Italian deli on ninth avenue and I was drawn right in The staff was very friendly and couldnt be more accommodating We tried a couple of paninis and they were really great I definitely recommend VIP The prosciutto was fresh and great and mozzarella was probably the best Ive ever had  Its also BYOB,1
Had our table ready Made reservation via email through their website No response so I called Lovely interior and very nice outdoor area to eat Service is good Food is good Wouldnt come back so fast Ac broken but its ok Unfortunately air doesnt flow inside They were accommodating as far as nut allergies go removing pistachios and sunflower seeds Fusilli needed flavor Broccolo and margherita pizzas were flavorful Chicken was good too Butalmost 200 for Dinner for 4 with 1 bottle of wine and no dessert is a little pricey,1
This was pretty good some of the things I liked in this book wereThe writing style is so good The characters are believable and the story flows so well,0
Items selected White Chocolate Raspberry Bread Pudding Chicken and Waffles  Cheddar Tabasco Waffle Crispy Sage Grilled Lemon Chili Butter and Maple Jus Croissant French Toast with Fresh Berries Mascarpone Cream Toasted Almond Crumble With my sister intentionally neglecting to suffer the lines at Dominique Ansel the decision was made to meet up at 247 Chelsea hotspot Cafeteria for breakfast and although Id admittedly heard some mixed things about service versus scene our visit really could not have been more pleasant the atmosphere light the service jovial and the food featuring fun takes on American comfort foods with everything from pancakes and French toast to steaks and burgers to the complete dessert menu available all day and all night Perhaps benefitting from an 8am shift change when both kitchen and front of house were fresh with servers zipping around the halffilled room it would be a matter of moments after taking a seat in a cozy back corner before Jorge visited our table and with a bit of chatter about daily specials menus were presented decisions came by with some difficulty as several options looked tempting and orders were placed  the food arriving fifteen minutes later while my sister and I watched the fashionable foot traffic on 7th Avenue Happy to indulge especially at breakfast but with an eye on both lunch and dinner it was with some restraint that we opted to limit the order to two plates and one dessert sticking to the tried and true we were well rewarded as all three items shined the croissant French toast a buttery dayold saturated through with eggy custard the chicken and waffles defiantly spicy and enormous with the syrup and lemon proving an ample foil and the bread pudding smooth and decadent crowned with ice cream even at 9am,1
Good story I truly enjoyed it and the characters I will definitely read more from this author I read this book in the last few days and have enjoyed it The characters are well written and well developed,0
Possibly the worst restaurant service Ive ever encountered Food reviews should give a boost to the restaurant however this restaurant deserves only one star because the food was good About two weeks ago my friends and I were out in the city and we were looking for a good place to eat As an iPhone user I used my Yelp application to look for a good yet affordable restaurant in Chinatown Unfortunately I happen to only look at the good reviews the ones that praise this restaurant Do not be fooled everyone After hours of walking in the city in 90 degree weather we had finally arrived at the destination following the GPS device One hostess gave us a ticket to wait in line We asked how long we would have to wait and she replied 15 minutes We thought to ourselves oh 15 minutes isnt so bad right Because we couldnt handle the heat some of us went into the bubble tea shop next door Luckily the air condition was on blast in this place We also found out that they do not accept credit card Oh bummer 30 minutes had passed by Still no sign of the hostess telling us that its our turn to be seated Strangely some people who came after us were getting seated before us We were confused We asked whats going on She gave us the dirtiest look and told us that the people were done eating but were talking and not leaving the restaurant Finally we were seated And what do we see We were sitting with four strangers First we thought it was four people who came in together but later we found out that they were two separate couples They also take the wrong order and expect you to just take the food and eat it We ordered a pork dish but that did not come out instead it was just general tsos dish I must say the pork buns were good All in all I believe that this place is mainly known for tourists who do not know the city well Here are some things to be wary of 1 Remember to have enough cash because 90 of restaurant in Chinatown do not accept credit cards There are ATMs nearby the area 2 Dont expect to be treated like an actual customer The waiters are very rude and hostile They just want to order everything for you by mistaking your orders 3 Be open to eat at the same table with strangers,1
This review is based on my experiences ordering takeout from SuzyQues This was the third time my wife and I got takeout here and sadly it will be the last To start their online menu clearly states that cornbread is included with all entrees The first time we got takeout they did not give us any cornbread at all The second time I made a comment about it when I ordered and they made sure to give us some This third time I brought our food home expecting cornbread only to find a single tiny cornbread muffin dry and smaller than a cupcake Just ONE muffin and we had ordered two entrees Is this a joke That would be forgivable if the entrees themselves were amazing But this time everything was just disappointing Baby back ribs were charred and tough and the pork sausage was also dry All in all the food was a huge let down After three tries Ive come to the conclusion that SuzyQues does not care much about quality or consistancy in their offerings and so we will be looking elsewhere next time we are in the mood for BBQ,0
Love The Boil I have to make the effort to come through here if Im in NYC The special boil sauce on everything You wont regret it,1
I was promised a long term job  instead I was hired off the books to help clean up and do the dirty work for the grand opening of stickys new location at 33rd st  and ultimately because I was never called back in for work or even when I made several attempts to contact the owner and he blatantly ignored my messages  I had to withdraw from college and begin career searching ASAP  Mean while the owner posts on Facebook thats there are positions available  Ive never made an error Ive always shown up to work on time and ready to work  there were no reasons to why I was fired if thats even whats that called  if your gonna lay me off at least have the decency to let me know  I got bills just like everyone else and needs just like everyone else  I dont understand how cruel you have to be  to be able to promise a position to some one and have them do the hard labor then ignore them and hire new people  Im sorry but you guys lost me as a customer and supporter ,1
Subject RUDE Customer Service We ate at the Tick Tock Diner with friends after travelling to New Jersey the night before to catch a show It was a getaway weekend so we wanted to look for fun places to eat We found the Tick Tock online and chose it based on the menu a thumbs up from the Food Network and its supposed local fame My friend had a few good options to consider as far as what to order She finally decided on the potato pancakes at 8 a plate because thats something she really loves and after hearing what she had about the place she was excited to get them What she was served however was 4 suspiciously uniform glorified hashbrowns with a big glob of sour cream in the middle and a small even for a condiment sized applesauce She was disappointed to say the least Look the rest of our food was pretty good and she quietly ate some accompaniments she had ordered and decided not to send them back When we were finishing she did however decide to call over a managerlike gentleman and explained the difference between the experience she expected and the one she received He basically stared at her with a blank  irritated look on his face and uttered a few comments aimed at dismissing her He quietly but defensively insisted that her take on the meal was wrong Knowing her she probably would have been satisfied with a simple apology which she never got  I realize that this is only a note on one of their menu choices but it doesnt give me confidence in the rest of the menu especially considering the lackluster attitudedriven way this item was defended by the management If Im ever in the clifton NJ area again Im going to avoid The Tick Tock Diner,0
Nice small restaurant that is quite warm Everyone raves about the burgers here but I came and had the pork confit enchiladas That was a pleasant surprise I didnt expect this dish to be spicy but it surely was I usually dont enjoy eating when Im sweating but the enchiladas were too good to stop The onion rings here were too fried for my taste I will come back and try the burger next time around,1
This is a great Adidas product The quality is good and the construction is solid I would recommend this product  The fit is perfect and the fit is great  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone  I would recommend it for anyone with an average sizeI bought this to replace the one I had when I lost my phone and it was a little uncomfortable I didnt want to spend the money on another one However it was perfect for me I used it to replace my original phone but I felt the phone was too small I was worried that it would break in So I used it again,0
4 chicken wrap I literally havent had anything else aside from the falafel because I love the wrap so much Nice guys and fairly quick service lines can get long at peak meal times Eat here,1
Stumbled into this place when back in the old hood for a funeral Wow Excellent food service etc The goulash was amazing authentic and filling Will def try and return,1
OK 2nd tim eout after everything calmed down with the grand opening andEhjust eh I understand the hype surrounding the big name and the hype in Univ City when it opened but getting straight to the facts of how the food tasted it just wasnt that great It was an OK burger tried fries this time out and for me the sweet potato fries were really bad although in fairness my wife liked them Last thing was the milkshake it came in a small glass no more then 12 oz and cost 5 3 sips and that baby was gone I agree with others go to 5 guys for a better more filling experience,0
Jai got hier soir la soupe de champignons les asperges aux amandes ainsi que les ctes dagneau le tout accompagn dun excellent Riesling Absolument fabuleux Lambiance est chaleureuse et le service impeccable Trs agrable faon de clbrer Bastille day Merci,0
I liked this place Service was really good Beer selection was good and reasonably priced Had a Vodka Pie that rivaled others on the island Spinach salad was pretty good too No complaints if Im in the area Id go back for sure,1
We live nearby this place and the mister had been bugging me to try it so we decided to enjoy this weekend of awesome weather and went for lunch One of our friends had dined here 3 times in 1 week so we had high hopes FOOD  kebab combination of lamb chicken and beef the lamb 3 pieces was cooked to a tender medium and was not overly gamey The chicken 2 pieces was what you would expect a chicken kebab to taste like however it was slightly dry The beef kebab 3 pieces was the least exciting as it was dry and did not have a broad spice profile like other kebabs weve had at other places The portion size did not justify the 17 price tag though  spinach rice tasted great but not memorable  eggplant seemed like it was all the rage on Yelp so my mister got it and enjoyed it I didnt try it not a fan but I must say the presentation was beautiful  mantoo the tender dumplings were wellstuffed with tasty meat and the skin of the dumplings were the right balance of chewy and tender The sauce complimented the dish very well  table bread some kind of a whole wheat flat bread that reminded me of a toasted bagel thin  slightly sweet the outside was lightly toasted and crunchy but the inside was soft and fluffy SO DELICIOUS  Eat it while its still warm or else it will get soggy  we got a Fish  Chips entree which was featured as one of the specials  the trout was perfectly fried and tasty The skin was crispy and the fish was flaky I was SO excited to eat the fries after having read a review here that it was the best fries in CT  but I was so disappointed to see soggy friends with some kind of cajunesque spice powder on it The fries were cut by hand I think so I appreciate the fresh potatoes  but the terrible knife work created fries that were nearly flat on one edge and super thick at the other This resulted in uneven cooking during the frying process and I found the fries to be pretty terrible This dish also comes with a forgettable salad AMBIANCE Its really exotic and decorated very well I agree with other reviews that you feel like you are transported to another place Beautiful rugs and decor everywhere There was a small stage in the upstairs area that may be for live music at night SERVICE Our server was working alone and was managing about 3 tables Yet she did not refill our waters even when coming back to our table to give us the additional bread we had requested  PARKING We parked right outside in one of the meters  lunch for 2 of us took 1 hour so we were glad we put in a dollar into the meters VALUE Aside from the combination kebab place most of the lunch menus entree items are about 10 or less which is great,1
One of my favorites Great service great food great atmosphere Shared many different dishes as they are on the smaller side but well worth the cost The roasted chicken was amazing Perfect balance of moistness and crispness The mushrooms were amazing with the fried egg on top and the tagliatelle in the bolognese sauce was to die for Also had the beef carpaccio and my boyfriend loved it but I was not a fan of the crunch and the gnocchi wasnt bad either For dessert we had the olive oil cake which was fantastic as well as a pavlova that was melt in your mouth delicious Highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a nice unique Italian experience,1
Excellent Authentic Dosas with proper chutneys and Samber  nicest Ive had in a while,1
Food was terrible wouldnt be surprised if there was no stove in the kitchen just microwaves Bar was Definitely over capacity no one was checking IDs and the older male manager was the most embarrassing unpleasant and very unprofessional This place really deserves zero stars,0
Had the moqueca pao de quiejo strawberry caipirinha eggplant dip flan oink oink All were delicious and Ive had a LOT of Brazilian food Also enjoyed the music mix playing and the ambiance para bens,1
I could seriously eat myself to death here Thank god I dont live in the East Village because I dont think I would have the selfcontrol to stay away Id be in there every day like Rosemary mayo Why Ive never tried that one before Ill just have a little cone And so it would go until Im 400 lbs And happy In short fries  mayo  orgasm Enjoy people Enjoy way too much,1
We stopped in here for a quick bite while waiting for a friend to join us for dinner somewhere else I know a snack before dinnerLEAVE US ALONE Anyway the snack was delicious Im not a fan of soft cheeses but I was all over this ricotta So good I hope to return very soon to try one of those amazinglooking flatbreads I salivated over,1
I stopped in on a random weekend one night for some late night pizza to be welcomed and offered food and drinks right off the bat Good start The oven pizza was kicking out some great pies I went with the bbq chicken Perfect It seemed that were was a upstairs for more dinning but I didnt get a chance to snoop This place has a great bar with plenty of poison for your liking Our server was very nice and made me want to come back soon Which I will have no problem doing hopefully sooner then later Service and personality is big in this business and this place has it down,1
I usually wouldnt stray too far off of Steinway for food but I was feeling especially yuppish after a session of yoga nearby so I figured why not finish the night off with a meal at Il Bambino The Yelp reviews were terrific and sure enough when I walked in almost every table had a couple with a bottle of wine on their table And I had originally thought this was just a sandwich place  The Fontina panini and the Artichoke panini were delicious Its one of those melt in your mouth comfort food experiences like mac and cheese I knew there were only like 23 ingredients inside but their unique combination and quality are what make them stand out,1
35 stars Good homemade pasta served al dente Sauces are all flavorful  I had the Fettucini with Salmon and the fish was cooked perfectly Second fave was Orechiette with sausage mushrooms in garlic wine sauce Seafood Risotto had lotsa of fresh seafood but the risotto part was lackluster favorless and the rice was too hard Noisy homestyle BYO Solid,1
Sit at the counter Its fun to watch  Eat the burger Use the chipotle mayo Be happy,1
Best value for delicious pasta Lots of fresh veggies and veggie options Yummy marinara,1
All too often I walk out of places thinking that meal was okay but definitely not worth the price On some occasions I say that was pretty good I didnt mind paying that Very very rarely can one say that the quality of a meal far exceeds the price you pay for it This was my experience at go go curry Some friends and I were looking for a quick meal by my job before a movie From the moment I walked in until the last lick of curry on my plate everything was absolutely perfect My friend and I were feeling ambitious and decided to share the grand slam Every morsel of and every grain of rice was so delicious and we feasted for the low price of about 675 each including tax Walking out of the restaurant I was in some kind of daze and when the little automated speaker over the door yelled out konnichiwa as we stepped out I was in absolute euphoria Ill definitely be visiting again,1
OMG This is what Clinton St Banana walnut pancakes do to you  talking in emoticons because full words do not even express how deliciously heavenly the pancakes taste YUM Yesterday was my longawaited return to Clinton St Its been 3 years since I have had the best breakfast in the world here and I had the perfect occasion to eat here with out of town guests wanting to be wowed My out of town guests are from sunny Florida where the idea of waiting for more than 15 minutes to eat a restaurant is absurd and rightly so So it took a lot of convincing to make them wait nearly 2 hours for brunch Thankfully the weather was sunny enough to stroll around the neighborhood but there were more than a few times when I had to lure them away from going to another restaurant The host was a really friendly guy who kept a friendly attitude despite all the hungry people waiting outside in hunger When we finally got seated my guests were instantly pleased with the freshsqueezed orange juice and grapefruit juice We decided to share our meals We ordered the bananawalnut pancakes divino salmon scramble absolutely delicious brioche french toast and spanish scramble along with sugar dipped bacon I never was so focused on stuffing my face and licking my plate clean I was determined to eat my entire meal because its simply too delicious to throw it away I havent enjoyed such a meal like that for awhile I am sure part of it is the hunger I experienced for waiting about 2 hours for food but the sunny relaxed atmosphere in the restaurant and the ffood makes this place a great choice when youre not in a rush,1
Beautiful restaurant with great potential The food is decent but the Irish menu does not match the Victorian theme Also the dance club style music does not match any part of the dining ambiance this is an easy fix by the mangers and staff Another job for the manager is to discuss customer service to their staff The waitress was not rude but seemed very spaced out and unknowledgeable about menu items After a 50 minute dining experience the waitress never refilled our drinks asked about our meal or gave us silverware for all 4 guests We ended up sharing forks and napkins Overall we revisited this restaurant because of the beautiful atmosphere but have had terrible service every time For a restaurant with such potential I hope that the managerowner can clean up the untrained staff,1
Giving this new gastropub 3 stars based only upon the drinks and the venue  I have not tried out the food yet We hit this place up sometime in late October The venue was pretty cool when entering kinda lounge like airy with tall vaulted ceilings The space is huge and its nice to see this Lackawanna terminal building finally get something done with The wine list is pretty awesome They had Caduceus wine from Arizona so that sold me  We met the owner and the manager who were both down to earth and provided good hospitality with plenty of insight on what there trying to do with Pig and Prince I glanced at the menu and they did have some stand out stuff that Id try sometime However the prices were a bit over the top for a gastropub so Ive yet to go back and try the food However a sleek interior good wine craft beers and great company kept us all till closing that evening so it was an enjoyable first time at the Pig  Prince Ill make a stop there again sometime,1
Im surprised by all the reviews The quality is good but Im not sure how well they will hold up The plastic parts are also not as good as the plastic parts but its okay Its not a big deal If it holds up to some abuse Ill buy another one for another house Im not sure if it will hold up to the,0
Have eaten here on several occasions and all of the food is topnotch The wait can get long and the bill can get steep It is Midtown after all though Highly recommend the wasabi shumai and the hamachi collar,1
I dont what everyone is talking about I just ordered a veggie burrito which i requested with guac and sour creme For some reason it ended up being 10 dollars and managed to be one of the most tasteless burritos Ive had Their tacos arent bad Ive had them before but dont compare to those at Veracruzana and even the newly installed taco truck at 8th and washington This is glorified cafeteria food glorified in that they make an effort to provide veg dishes and allow you to order online,1
Tinks is an awesome place for small plates My friend and I each ordered a small plate of our own then split one and we were content I ordered the Pretzel Crusted Fried Chicken and we split the Quaky Tots  both really good Tinks also had a really fun selection of American craft beer Tinks is a small place but my friend and I didnt have any trouble getting seated It was actually very dead during the week at least  we were the only ones in there The server was nice but left us alone to the point where it felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant Nothing wrong with that though,1
Awful service Food came out tainted with plastic and spoiled ceasar dressing on different occassions  Never going back Owner didnt care and was put off by the fact we were upset,1
Okay so first you have to ask yourself Self What kind of brunch do I want today If your answer is boozy latin sangria brunch without much concern for classic brunch food or other drink options then this is the place for you Heres the deal you order something on their brunch menu prices range from 1218 and you get free unlimited access to their EXTENSIVE selection of Sangria Pretty fantastic The brunch menu isnt very extensive mostly just classic Latin dishes with scrambled eggs thrown in for brunchyness but the burrito I had was pretty good The sangria selection on the other hand is much more exciting Basically theres a table with six or seven different kinds of sangria for you to choose from and you can pour yourself as many different glasses as youd like The venue is also really nice Very high ceilings lots of space and there are booths and tables available Theres a lounge and bar in the front and then a large dining room in the back Make reservations if possible though as its apparently gotten more popular recently The only reason Im giving it four stars instead of five is that the sangria isnt delicious Its okay but its definitely not the best Mine was kind of watery and flavorless That said its practically FREE soyeah Im not complaining,1
DEEELLICCCIOUS Best square slice of pizza I have had yet  And we didnt have to wait that long Most of the line is waiting for a regular slice  So if you are in a hurry or dont feel like waiting  the square slice is AMAZING I would however enjoy a spot to sit and eat it or even just a little more room to stand and a drink on They should think about putting high boys high bistro table both inside and outside This place is a true Italian pizzeria The father is the ONLY one that is allowed to make the pizza I almost feel a little bad for the son thats takes orders when does he get his time to shine Yum yum My mouth is watering just thinking of it,1
We arrived at the place around 630pm and waited for nearly an hour to be seated The ramen joint is small most customers are seated at the kitchen bar and there are a few tables in the back The restaurant received an A from the department of health Since I received a food protection license I have been aware of whats right or wrong in the kitchen Not everyone follows the regulations We ordered the Avo Tuna I really like how the ingredients played out Only if the chefs add less soy sauce it could have been perfect Im still thinking whats the crunchy stuff on the top of the tuna I ordered chicken paitan ramen while my boyfriend had the spicy ramen I found my ramen to be very creamy but the sliced pork was juicy When I tried my boyfriends ramen you can taste the spiciness and the powder He also found the ramen to be creamy too At the end my stomach didnt feel that well Im lactose intolerant I wonder if the creaminess is milk,1
I liked this place Why food tasty and fresh prices reasonable and food served quickly I had breakfast there recently on a Saturday and the place was bopping Theres a big selection other than just something on a bagel You place your order and then the food is brought over to your table I will be back,1
This has to be one of the best places to get a great breakfast The first thing you notice is that it is very very clean It makes you feel comfortable when you sit down to eat Also you can see the staff preparing the food which is a huge plus in my book Their menu isnt insanely huge or confusing Its straight up breakfast with a few kicks and quirks and thats it Whatever you get add the Turkish sausage I saw it mentioned here on a few reviews and for good reason Its THE thing to try if youre here for the first time,0
Cheeseburger is still excellent but dont get the sushi It just isnt that good Ever since they closed their standalone sushi place the quality of the sushi has gone downhill and detracted from my overall Blue Ribbon experience,1
Was visiting NY and my friend took me out to dinner here for my birthday The wine is very good here The waiters were having a bad night though I think as they almost spilled food all over me but it didnt get me The owner seemed really stressed honestly but she was trying her best The food was pretty good Very Italian like pizza The calzone was probably what I liked better though,1
Blech I live around the corner and I really like middle eastern food so I keep coming here hoping that it will be good this time  Alas my hopes are once again dashed by tasteless greasy falafel and kofta drowned in tahini,1
On the NorthWestern edge of Brooklyn in Green Point lies a hidden notyetwellknown restaurant The passion and dedication of its owner Thomaso a first generation Italian immigrant is seen smelled tasted and felt in every corner on every surface and in every dish Family recipes passed down through time find their way onto the menu and warms the soul with each bite Its a magical place With an understated panache Milk and Roses woos you when you first walk in But its Thomasos spirit embodied in his selfdescribed decrepit interior and infused into the dishes such as the prawn risotto octopus and shellfish soup or redwine poached pear dessert that leaves you wishing the clock didnt say closing time As the jazz playlist fades into the shadows of Manhattans lights and the last few notes of Cynar dance across your tongue Milk and Roses reminds you that this city is built on the hopes of immigrants and dreamers alike and once inawhile one of their stars shines extra bright,0
What a fantastic place The food for brunch and dinner is amazing We went here the first time for Saturday breakfast yes not brunchit was 9 when we arrived since I looked up that theyre open 24 hours on weekend The meal was lovely and our party of 4 enjoyed every bite I especially loved the pumpkin pancakes and hummus option  it was a nice change to the usual breakfast menu After such a great breakfast experience my bf and I decided to check them out a few weeks later for their dinner menu That def exceeded my expectations He had the falafel platter and I went with the sesame Salmon Both dishes we amazing The falafels were perfectly crunchy as well as nongreasy on the outside and very moist on the inside As for the Salmon I was in heaven It was not overcooked and came with such a beautifully tasty assortment of veggies This place is absolutely a solid dining option in the East Village,1
What a fantastic experience We have frequented many of the best restaurants in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs and I must say that this was probably one of the best dining experiences The food  exceptional Try the tenderloin the frommage on toast grilled romaine pepper caulifloweron and on Service was impeccable Great wine and an even better mojita The ownermanager checked on most of the tables while we were there asking for anything that could be tweaked I could not think of anything for him to improve,1
A diamond in the rough Meatballs and Brew is in the old Flynns location Parking can be a little difficult on the street but the municipal lot behind the Waiting Room is very close by  The bar area is shaped like a capital L with flat screen TVs very well placed to catch all the sports action We have come here twice now and both times sat at the bar The first visit the bartender was good but may not have communicated the happy hour specials clear enough to us She said all drafts were 1 off but the bill said the drafts were 6 so that means they were initially 7 That didnt seem right When we ordered food husband had the Spicy Pork Meatball Hero with Parmesean Cheese Sauce and Provolone Cheese and fries for 10 It was about an 8 inch long sandwich with 4 meatballs and he enjoyed it I had sliders for 3 each I tried the beef spicy pork and chicken with different sauces Everything was between just fine and good Nothing extraordinary The other time we came back we only came for drinks and the vibe was pretty depressing Local musicians were taking turns playing sets and the guy we heard played really slow mournful tunes We came for the Halloween party so this was confusing and not the scene we expected So heres the truth The meatballs and sauces arent anything amazing but they are good Just nothing incredibly special Being that this place is all about meatballs youd expect them to be out of this world We will give this place another shot and just hope not to wind up there for slow depressing live music night,1
I feel like theres a lot of hype around this place but it doesnt seem to live up Ive gone maybe 5 times in the last 15 months I love the mango mojito They have flights of mojitos as a happy hour special one day a week that was probably my favorite experience here I love mexican food but i felt like the chicken was usually kind of bland The chicken fajitas have an ok flavor but it seems like they grill a chicken breast and then cut it up instead of cutting it up and then cooking it The chips are yummy Rice and black beans are decent Guacamole is good But its just lacking some sort ofpizazz,1
Fear not savoryphiles this is NOT just a bakery serving up cupcakes and croissants and the like This IS an amazing little eatery serving up Central Asian Uzbek fare like lamb pilaf lamb or mushroom samosas tiny veal dumplings with ginger scallion sauce and extra broth and lagman Now it is a bit of a trek from Downtown We drove in and entered the McGinley Square neighborhood a veritable melting pot of so many cultures I felt like I was in such a different Jersey City  one even more diverse if you can imagine it Tucked in with neat rowhouses was Honey Bakery a tiny little oasis of charm and delectable treats There were only 3 tiny tables inside and 2 outside The owner and chef rolled out a huge pumpkin samosa for us on the spot  flaky crunchy crust NOT fatty and savory pumpkin flavor inside The lamb pilaf was TO DIE FOR  loaded with subtle roasted cumin flavor studded with cumin seeds succulent bits of lamb carrots onions and simply amazing This is the standout dish for sure We liked it so much we ended up trying the veggie pilaf too  which is great but not as flavorful as the lamb one  Lastly we rounded out this adventure into Central Asia with the mini veal dumplings  15 or 20 to an order they were like little tortellini filled with meat ginger and subtle Asian spices All of this for less than 20 We were bursting at the seams As an added bonus the fresh grocer nearby was selling AMAZING produce at even more amazing prices I got 8 small nectarines for 1 And they were tart sweet juicy and perfect,1
i should change my last meal on yelp to be anything from cafe habana because if i was hit by a crazy cab driver and killed after walking out of this joint i would die happy the corn of course is phenomenal i cant say enough about that i had the tostones recently and they are great  almost as good as my beloved orinoco in the south end in boston the drinks are also great and make up for the annoying as hell wait ive gone there are varying times of the day and i have always always always had to wait the service can be a little iffy too mostly because the waitresses are too busy looking beautiful to actually hustle your food out of the kitchen,1
So Im not one to be excited about a tourist trap I had seen the reviews the lines and it really is all about location location location Nestled in between all the major theaters its a prime spot for beforeafter a play We came out of our play late in the evening and we were starved We decided we would wait and experience Jrs for ourselves The wait wasnt terrible it was almost 11pm so any wait is a nusance when you are starved and exhausted but it was less than expected and the staff was very nice The tables are cramped but the noise level wasnt bad at all The decor is fun and intersting and it helped as we waited The server brought us complimentary coleslaw and pickles and beets with onions WONDERFUL If you arent used to that kind of thing it sounds weird but just trust me  try it We got the potatoe latkes because you have to that were as big as our heads and each of our meals were hardy and tasty including the lowly grilled american cheese sandwich with french fries  a classic The black and white cookies were some of the best we have had and we have had our share and my rugelach well they were fabulous and there were many of them so I had them over the course of several days Our server was friendly attentive and very nice He smiled and was friendlier to us after midnight than most servers to can muster at a more normal time of the day Im glad we went  it was a necessary experience As expected it was very pricy but the quality of the food and amount of it made it feel worthwhile,1
ordered food before 730 it FINALLY came at 9 pm Called several times they didnt really care we were waiting so long We were just told it was busy and food was coming out Never again will I order from here definitely not worth it or their rude and very long delivery service especially since I live less then 5 min away food was just okay nothing special or worth the wait,1
This is a great cafe Friendly lowkey great coffee and bagel sandwiches They love kids here and dogs Its everything thats good about the Italian Market without any of the bad Love this place,1
Tastes good but their tzatziki is ranch,1
This book is so helpful As I writer I can defiantly say this book helped me learn new ways and tips about how to do it right in kindle publishing and not less important how to enjoy it I read many books about this topic and still this book has thought me so many new things that are helpful for me as a writer I will recommend this book to all my fellow writers Its a real treasure,1
Simply amazing For the record Im generally lazy so i eat out often and Im kind of a snarky ahole when it comes to restaurant management concept execution i was in the biz It doesnt bother me to say that this place nailed it From the moment I stumbled in until I signed the tab everything was flawless even the annoying hipsters werent so annoying probably because they were feeding My hat is off to the owner creator You bastard I wish I owned it Oh well I was expecting an Italian type of joint but it really is a menu built around the mighty meaty deliciously oily meatball Meatwad fans rejoice Never being here before I looked around the room to get some ideas I was hungry I got a Hero and a Naked balls with mushroom gravy The hero came with a small tasty salad too so thats a point in the healthy column We dont so much count the 3000 calories of bourbon we just drank Thats an off ledger entry The Naked balls with mushroom gravy was the six sigma event There are foods created by masters to be enjoyed by experts so that they can talk about how wonderful they all are however much like a brilliant rainbow kissing a Kansas landscape of freshly watered sunflowers mortals enjoy the spectacle perhaps forbiddingly Each meaty mushroom bite was accompanied by a slight Sorcerers Apprentice vibe Der Zauberlehrling Buttery meaty mushroomy deliriously greasy whatever the adjective you will join the choirs to sing praise of this Meatball Mushroom gift Since I live so far uptown I ordered some meatballs to go for lunch the following day Everything was packed to perfection even the forks were heavy duty not that wimpy mouth cutting Chinese take out crap,1
I hate waiting for food but I make an exception for this place Best ramen in NYC,1
Pretty restaurant with mediocre overpriced foodSmall portions that embarrassed me and my group Will go elsewhere next time when I want a good meal,0
I loved the pizza I could eat it all day long The house margarita pizza is perfect Great sauce and cheese,1
Oh my God The BEST BEST BEST food of any kind anywhere Five star quality food Best hummus anywhere in North America I defy you to find better falafel anywhere on the planet including Lebanon The falafel are amazingly fresh and crunchy and not a bit greasy The chicken is cooked with world class flavors The homemade baklava is to die for Dont miss the mjudara the vegetarian kibbeh the kibbeh kabobs and THE SOUP It seems about half their business is take out so call pick up and eat a truly home cooked meal in your home People I know whove been to Lebanese restaurants all over the world make their way back to Headquarters in North Brunswick NJ Do not pass it up BYOB BTW there are multiple choices for Lebanese food in the area This is not meant to be a fine dining experience There is no bar no wine list longer than the food menu no private room But the food here the FOOD is absolutely unmatchable And while not cheap is less than half the price you would spend elsewhere And again BYOB I agree with others that the friendly but less than stellar service is part of the homey ambiance of this place If you are in a hurry call well ahead for take out,1
These are great cheap sunglasses for cycling They fit well with good wraparound coverage Rubber grips on the earpieces keep them firmly in place whether on my head or stuck into my helmet The fact that they are so cheap means I dont care if they get damaged or lost so far not yet,1
Never had better tasting Misobased ramen besides Japan of course I hate to say this but I like it better than Momofuku Noodle,1
Went here with my friend again last night its still awesome I dont get here often because I live almost thirty minutes away but it is well worth the trip every time Everything on the menu is good I really love the Kadu Sombosas the qabuli palow and pretty much everything else My friend tried the Hookah and loved it The chai is wonderful especially on a cold like last night The decorations have changed since last time I have been there and I think it looks a lot nicer The service was friendly and attentive as always,1
Awesome place It has a real left coast feelI typically despise the notion of breakfast and lunch Whaddya call that thing I have got to scream from the rafter tops about the Hangover Pizza I know I knowEvery review practically raves about this thing of beauty I didnt even want to order it but I got that look come ordering time from my lady Done deal Hangover Pizza table 3 This thing arrives at the table and I am confused eager and nervous at the same time How can something so simple be so visually arresting Nice size pie perfectly thin crust A light coating of sauce cheese herbs and pepperoncino Pancetta and crumbled sausage Here and there and everywhere In the middle are two fried eggs I cant believe I almost forgot what seems to be diced butter poached potato Thats what it looks like Heres how it tastes This doesnt typically happen for me My brain and my mouthroomates went absolutely batshit crazy The sauce was perfect Just the right touch of garlic Combine that with the myriad flavors of fresh herbsheat and smoke the creaminess of the cheese and the fried eggs on top that let you go into the longest runon sentence ever on Yelp because it was so good your brain is damaged forever and everIf they had chosen to scramble the eggs and portion them about the pie it wouldnt work The eggs in the middle allow the diners to break and carve the egg thus tailoring their own slice The ONLY reason it doesnt get 5 stars Both times I went the yolk was not runny It wasnt hard boiled still day glow yellow I just happen to like runny yolks Thats my problem I guess If you dont go here for this you are either crazy stupid or crazystupid,1
Dont ever go here I went for breakfast and for starters they dont open till 10 on sat and sun The service was horrible and the food was below average The biggest gripe I had though was the price A egg frittata was 10 but the charge for cheese was 375 the onions and tomatoes were 275 each  How can they seriously charge more for the added veggies and cheese than the frittata I did question the waiter about the charge and the owner came to my table He was very unprofessional and rude about my issue I live in town and will make sure to announce to everyone I know to never step foot in the place,0
I think this place cant decide if its a sports bar or a fancy restaurant If its a sports bar lower the prices If its a fancy restaurant remove the 2flatscreentvswiththeknicksgameon and tell the boredlooking waiter not to dress like hes about to mow the lawn baggy jeans long hair and a long sleeved untucked baggy tshirt  While my burger and fries were very good the atmosphere and priciness drives my rating down,1
Encore visit was a disappointment  Annoyed hurried service Never checked on our meals never apologized for lapses Luke warm entree  Expected a nice holiday dinnerinstead felt ripped off Saturday night crowds may be the culprit but tell that to my wallet,1
We came around close and they held the kitchen open for us 1 We asked for recommendations for vegetarian pizza and local sustainable beer Our pizzas was bland The beer was too We left I wanted to like Kitchen Zinc I pass it often the heart of the Temple Street Plaza and theres always a 2030something party and it looks romantic when the patios open Inside though its dank TVs blaring at the bar killed the artisan vibe Let this trend die,1
My favorite restaurant in NYC without a doubt Phenomenal food service and ambiance Im scared to say this is so as its wonderful that I can still get a late night booking at a moments notice Perfect accompaniment post cocktails at Employees Only or after the SNM show or for a special treat yourself occasion or anytime really you feel like indulging in splendor of the palate and a fine dining experience without the wankery of other top notch restaurants,1
Were going back this weekend Im not sure if we will make it for dinner or brunch this time but we are absolutely going back We finally tried out Brooklyn Star and everything you read is true The food is insanely good and you will be full all day if you have brunch They have communal seating so you may end up sitting with strangers but your mouth will be full of food so you dont have to talk to them unless you want to lol I had the Apple Johnny Cakes aka pancakes with scrambled eggs super thick bacon almost like short ribs and a hash brown that I was too full to eat We also had buttermilk biscuits to start with butter and honey and cocktails Hubby had the ham steak with fried eggs and mashed potatoes I tasted his meal and it was delicious too  We got out leftovers to go but Im not really sure how to heat up pancakes I did eat the leftover biscuit 15 seconds in the microwave and I ended up tossing the hash brown since it had too much of an onion smell for me Although Im sure it was really tasty Brunch with 3 cocktails was 61  tip  I wish I knew the name of our server tall dark hair tats He was super attentive without being annoying and we rewarded him with a 20 tip For brunch you cannot make any changes or substitutions so be aware This includes the bar No Mai Tais and no Long Island Ice Tea Hubby is not a fan of fried eggs so he just threw them out He was already full from the super thick ham steak and mash potatoes plus the buttermilk biscuit  I plan to try the mac  cheese with bacon the shrimp  grits and the chicken  waffles over the next few visits We have found our new brunch spot Edited 42113 So we have been back a couple of times and I tried the mac  cheese with bacon late night around 11 pm they spicy chicken wings late night around 11 pm and the chicken  waffles brunch in addition to a Pimms Cup and Dr Pepper cocktail late night The food is really good The service has been good too each and every time I cant recommend the Dr Pepper cocktail Dr Pepper syrup gin and grapefruit juice and I cant recommend the Pimms cup sort of like a Long Island but not however the food alone is worth the trip The John Daly vodka mixed with iced tea and lemonade is very good A pitcher is 32 which is about 4 servings I still need to try the shrimp  grits Get there early for brunch and by early I mean by 1145 am for the 12 pm opening If not its better to just wait until around 3 pm There was a line by 1155 am of maybe 30 people I dont recall ever seeing a line down the block waiting on brunch and a few other people in line made the same comment Plan to spend about 60 for brunch for two with two cocktails more if you go for dinner Edited 42813 I finally tried the shrimp  grits Excellent The biscuits were a bit over cooked visibly burned on the outside but still good Now I only need to try the cinnamon bun and I will have worked my way through the menu items I wanted to try,1
Im just ok with it I like the atmosphere and love the North Broad location The prices are surprisingly reasonable and the beer selection is ample As for the food it was ok The house made pickle was a stand out as for the other options I sampled I was underwhelmed The pretzel bites were good but they are pretzel bites all the same The polenta balls were bland the house chips were heavy and the veggie burgerpancake was overshadowed by the abundance of garnish  Im just realizing now everything I had was vegetarian and Im not a vegetarian Perhaps Ill revisit and focus my attention on the meat Expect a followup,1
Great soup dirt cheap I had the oxtail hand drawn noodles my brother had the duck Its like half a duck in a bowl of soup for 6 bucks Also try their smoothies,1
Wow I was so impressed by this place Everything from the cocktails to the service to the dishes was impeccable Pricy but very tasty A little too much of the food was fried in my humble opinion though I loved the fish tacos fried hearts of palm fried calamari fried french fries  and the dark and stormy cocktail in particular Also the suckling pig was really delicious,1
I visited Fogo de Chao for my birthday with a large group of 8 I have been to Sal  Carvao in Schaumburg IL several times and was excited to have churrascaria in the Philly area Unfortunately I found the variety and quality of the food to be lacking Now that is something you werent expecting to hear were you While a churrascaria would seem such a place to be a vegetarians nightmare I found SC to have a huge salad bar with quite a variety at Fogo not much more than an expansive salad bar at a good restaurant just a fancier presentation As for the meat their were a few thing difficult to obtain but more strikingly was the poor quality of the meat Much of the sirloin and filet was full of gristle If this were Applebees fine maybe but not here not at these prices Lastly we had a 1 12 year old who barely ate anything mostly playing with a few selections from the salad bar that they tried to bill us for Are they nuts How do you confuse a 1 12 year old in a high chair to a 5 year old,1
Best burgers in Brooklyn since Dubuque I had the Pub Burger It was cooked perfectly and so delicious The bartender suggested dipping the fries in the house sauce which was amazing but I think they were spectacular even on their own,1
I have a hard time deciding how to rate this place This review is more about service than food because I never really got my food  I met two friends for dinner after they finished eating I joined late and was planning on eating after them since I had a gig in city and knew the kitchen was open late I arrived at 9pm and there were not many tables in front or back My friends had just finished and check was still open Ordered mac and cheese and kale salad After 30 minutes theres maybe 6 other diners I still havent gotten my food Someone who came in after me just got there food and I still havent seen our waitress I ask the bartender who comes to clear our drink glasses to check on my food He comes back and says its on its way Ive worked service before and I know that means someone screwed it up and it just got fired We were leaving soon so I said cancel the mac and just bring the greens After a few more minutes the waitress comes back to apologize that it is 100 her fault  Okay Thats cool she apologized and I said its fine Ive worked service before and stuff happens She brought out salad BUT if its your fault and you own up to it offer something in return Pick up a few drinks take the salad off bring the mac on the house or something so I will want to come back But no She got off shift sat at the bar next to us had her dinner and left without ever bringing our check or offering to close out Later bartender closed us and bought a few rounds thanks you sir Ive heard the food is pretty good but I can think of sooo many other places that have a 30 steak and have better service,1
Normally I dont like Chinese food I always find it tastes the same is just fried globs of mystery meat and has enough MSG to kill a man twice my size Thank god my boyfriend introduced me to the Emp This is the best Chinese food in Philly hands down The wonton soup tastes clean and fresh and is perfect for this cold season Ive sampled a wide variety of the chicken dishesthe Chicken with Broccoli is on point and the lemon sauce that is served with the Lemon Chicken is light and not too sweet I like that they give you the option for brown rice This is also a great option if you have vegetarianvegan friends that you are dining with They have an entire vegetarianvegan menu which pretty much mirrors the regular menu It is glutenheavy FYI When I want Chinese this is the only place I go to Theyre dependable deliver on a bike and the portions are big enough to get three meals out of All around win,1
5 for an iced tea with no refills So 10 for 2 ice teas Whats that like a 50000 markup My loan shark couldnt even get away with that It also makes me wonder what kind of margins they feel they need to operate attheir wines by the glass are some of the smallest glasses and smallest pours Ive ever seen and where else theyre cutting corners and nickel and dimeing Im sorry but as Ive said before Ive worked in many kitchens so I cant help it if the first thing I do is food cost analysis 1 That alone is enough to get me to not come here again Why dont they realize if theyre nice Im more likely to come back 2 The snotty attitude when my brunch date sent back her entree because she really really didnt like it also enough to get me not to come back here again But I guess her sending it back cuts into their fciking precious margin If Im being nice Id say this is not a winning formula BTW the food is mediocre at best and the portions are tiny If I stoop to their level Id say theyre snots and turds and I dont know why anyone would patronize this place,1
Im a Huge fan of Will  Grace I think it is without a doubt one of the best shows on TV That said this season was about 5050 and for a show thats previous seasons were 9010 that doesnt say much This season for some reason the shows creators decided it was time for Grace to get married They chose Harry Connick Jr as her love interest Leo This decision threw the show completely off the course and in my eyes changed what the show was about Two friendsIt became more about Grace getting married being a newlywed and trying to deal with a husband that wasnt around quite so much Karen and Jack remain hilarious as always Jack continues his career of being a struggleing actor and Karen divorces Stan after discovering he was having an affair with Minnie Driver who was suprisingly HILARIOUSThe one thing that I will say about this season is that it has some of the funniest episodes of the series Mainly the season finale which features Karen Will Grace and Jack putting Stan to rest at sea Without giving away too too much two of the characters go overboard someone might be cheating and two characters end up in bed together By far one of the funniest episodes EVERGood show and just a ok seasonStill worth the buy,1
Nice place to eat off Broadway Atmosphere is very nice over all I had the BBQ chick and ribs with fries My god was there a lot of food Chicken was good and I loves the ribs For dessert I had of course the cheese cake Man was it good Overall it was a good place to eat and will return,1
Heavy duty  Hold my iPad in the case and its a nice piece of equipment ,0
This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhoodtheres pretty much nothing aside from Starbucks or Cosi nearby But I was a bit miffed to find out that the 2 cup of tea I bought came in what had to be a sixounce cup They have no larger sizes aside from a pot that costs 4something This is bizarre aberrant and unfortunate Otherwise nice spot,1
This is my favorite wine bar in NYC The service is always top notch they have a great selection of wine and beer and the food is excellent,1
Love it,1
I dont know why this place is getting such great reviews I guess good food isnt one of the criteria its getting rated by If youre basing the review on the view youre looking at gas storage tanks beautiful I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder The staff was extremely friendly very attentive to our needs The drinks are made with just the right amount of alcohol thats about the only thing thats on point with quality and price Aside from that Id say the place is over price Im not paying for the view Im paying for food and I dont think its worth the price Yes they have some very nice appetizers the crab fitters are great so are the spring rolls but theyre both overpriced considering the portions served The dishes are big portions but they fall short on taste The three plates we ordered were all bland nothing stood out if youre going for drinks and a light meal order from the appetizer menu otherwise Id say skip for dinner,1
Stopped here before going to see The Book of Mormon on Broadway We did the brunch special 1395 each plate that comes with coffee or tea and an alcoholic beverage yay I got eggs benedict with bacon home fries and a bloody mary My boyfriend got scrambled eggs bacon an english muffin french toast home fries and a screwdriver Everything was good but the french toast was more like a plain fried piece of bread without any cinnamon or sugar on it It tasted fine with the syrup though Service was good and helpful I dont think this places specialty is breakfastbrunch but probably more of a lunchdinner place We came in just because we were hungry and saw the specials on the sign outside All in all very good If Im ever in the area again Id come back,1
Everything on the menu is reasonably priced for the large portions and the quality of the food It is not Moroccan the spices and the way the food is cooked are not reminiscent of it but it is still scrumptious I love that it is BYOB and wish it were not CASH ONLY The waitstaff to consumers is what keeps me from giving Figs five stars I think Figs doesnt realize how successful they are and therefore refrain from hiring additional staff and take on more than they can handle,1
I have lived a block away for several years and just tried Figs for dinner tonight I have to say Im disappointed in myself for not stumbling across this long ago Everything we ordered was delicious The baked brie app was a wonderful start Sweet and gooey but not too heavy The complimentary bean spread was a better version of hummus in my opinion Next we ordered the seafood risotto and grilled chicken in lemon rosemary sauce Both were exceptional and carefully prepared For dessert we had the fig ice cream and brownie which sealed this as a new favorite spot Cant wait to go back and try out the rest,1
Steves Prince of Steaks is actually the best and now that there is a center city location i am ecstatic they both lack in meat but the taste makes up for it,1
The raw bar is awesome especially the vast array of East and West coast oysters I love their mixed drinks too Cant wait to go back in the warm weather and sit outside,1
I worked near the area and really liked ordering their soup of the day since it came with the garlic panini bread The soups were pretty good too on the days I ordered it would be tomato cream soup and other times lentil They also have some decent baked goods They had cupcakes from Crumbs and this really dense chocolate cake that tasted like ganache Ill definitely be coming back to eat there when I visit and bring my friends along,1
I got really excited when I heard that Perry Street was a more casual Jean George restaurant which is why I was expecting pretty quality food Unfortunately it wasnt very impressive and lucky me I had the pleasure of coming to this belowpar restaurant two days out of the same week by coincidence  DECOR the space is very nice chic and clean SERVICE Im sorry but I feel like the managers and the service people here dont have the highest IQ Our table was missing utensils they would bring bread for two when there were three people and when we asked for the missing bread and utensils they just never came back with it mixed up our drinks and I was quite surprised that the waiter does not know the menu very well  FOOD Not Jean George quality at all no wonder its the lower end version or at least the winter menu was not Definitely dont get the gulf shrimp for lunch or dinner  they were tiny toughtochew shrimp The chicken in some broth was actually surprisingly good and moist The salmon and the chili poached snapper were okay but the snapper didnt have another flavor The lunch time hanger steak is a definite no  the meat was rubbery For dessert the lemon meringuesomething was very good but the chocolate pudding was more like eating mousse the only positive  if you come here for lunch its 24 for two entrees and dessert Overall this is a nice place to try but you can probably get a nicer experience for the price and location No wonder there were so many empty tables at lunch,1
FourthFifth time here Why did I rate it a 3 Because the service is just abnormally slow and not super attentive  And Im all about the quick and attentive service Expect to be here at least 2 hours every time you come and for food to show up at least 30 minutes after you order Food is great especially if you order the right things If you havent tried the brussel sprouts I think our table ordered 34 of them and fought over it haha duckbeef shawarma or lamb chops  do it These are my top few dishes here  I usually hate falafels because I apparently never tried a really good one before but this places falafels were actually yummy this is coming from a diehard meateater The frieeess are garlicy and fried to perfection Hummus with pine nuts is yum and not too grainy There was another smokey version of hummus ordered dont remember what it was called but I really dislike the taste of charrednesscomplete burntfood flavor If youre into eating charburnflavored food get it Hindbeh Dandelion Greens was an interesting salady choice to try out Citrus Trout  was actually pretty good They debone the fish so you dont have to worry when you eat  Grapefruit was bland though  Tried the Dark Chocolate Hazelnut Souffle this time  awesome delectable yumminess in one a bit pricey though  Previous visits Had my favorite dishes but there are a few meats I did not like at all here I would need to go back to my old pictures to figure out which ones they were though I recall they were meat dishes that were pretty dry Dont get the bone marrow  it was WAAAY too SALTY blegh,1
Ok before I get to the good here is the badthe waiting is terrible but the food is the best So call in your order The Israeli salad is awesome but the Greek Salad is bigger and better Their falafel is the best I have ever had I more of a traditional person but have tried the other two flavors and they too are amazing  The falafel platter or the sandwich are my go to items on the menu,1
We went there on a Monday night had two of the driest steaks ever  when I told the waitress about the steaks being dry she sent out the cook who asked us about the steaks being dry and when we confirmed that they were dry he walked away insulted with no apology Anyone could see that we didnt finish the food when I asked the waitress to wrap the leftovers so I could take the steaks home and beat them with a hammer she replied you do what you have to do When I asked for a round of drinks after we got the bill she said that wed have to pay for the round instead of comping us the round of drinks for the steaks being terrible  where are the people skills in this business We spent 100 for steaks that were drier than sand,1
Two wordsVeggie Wings HOORAY So great that this place has a vegetarian option that will be fun to eat during football season I dont see myself craving the wings or anything like that but they are good and a lot of fun to eat for a lifelong vegetarian who has never had the hot sauce all over your fingers experience I also had the grilled corn which I think was really yummy I will be back to try more things on the menu and possibly add some more stars,1
Formerly known as Capri Cafe now called Sole Di Capri Besides the name change everything appears to be the same   Authentic Italian from the first step through the door The space is tiny but never obnoxiously crowded The staff is sweet mostly Italianspeaking and super friendly  Portions are moderately sized and relatively inexpensive The menu has a great selection of pasta all of which are consistently incredible Fresh ingredients and authentic recipes keep me coming back frequently,1
I hadnt been here in years I needed a brunch spot that takes reservations because sometimes you just CANNOT wait to eat with a group of friends The food was great I had the shrimp huevos rancheros I would suggest they add more tomato salsa to the dish The bloody mary was spicy and the pickled tomato a great addition My only complaint is that the place needs to figure out someway to keep customers warm while the front door is being opened every 3 seconds Its a busy place Its the winter I want to be cozy at brunch and not shivering when the front door opens See what you can do about that Jane,1
Amazing pizza and worth the trip if you are ever in Wayne NJ They are part of the big 3 Tonys Neils and Vinnies all of which have great pizza I prefer the specialty pies at Neils but the plain slice at Tonys Their Chicken Vodka pizza is the best specialty slice in the world,1
Nasty clueless staff confused crowd and uncomfortable space With all the lovely French places in New York City this is absolutely not worth the waste of an evening Our party of 2 arrived at 830pm on a Friday and were told we were next in line for a table At 915 we were told 2 minutes We watched another girl angrily explaining to the maitred that she had been waiting for over an hour and of course kept waitingpacked near the doorway with other wouldbe diners and clipped left and right by staff We would have loved to get out of the way for a bit and come back but were told we would have to be physically present to be seated Another woman who arrived after us was wordlessly handed a piece of chalk to put her name on the doorframe At 940 we requested an update and were told literally Tomorrow tomorrow morning I dont know When we requested a timeframe for real we were told An hour Two hours I explained in a normal tone of voice that we had waited an hour already and the maitred acted as if I had attacked him Dont yell at me he cried I wasnt yelling  I explained but the man ignored me turned on his heel and left in an angry huff We were finally seated at around 1015 hungry and miserable after what felt like a hostile interaction After we had placed our order a second waiter arrived and asked if we needed menus No thanks we said We quickly polished off our glasses of rose and two tiny plates each At around 1115 we ordered 1 slice of tarte tatin to split for dessert from a 3rd waiter who had been lingering by us for a while with a whole tarte in his hands he actually came back and asked us Have you made your decision re tarte Then after 20 minutes of waiting for the slice our original waiter asked if we were ok We explained about the tarte and our waiter blamed us for asking the wrong waiter telling us he would bring the dessert in just a second At this point we had spent so many hours in the restaurant we decided to pass on dessert and asked him for the check It took another 15 minutes to get even that from yet another waiter I have never wanted so badly to just get up and leave a restaurant We did not make it out of there until after midnight,0
The service is why I give this place one star The service is constantly horrible The waitresses dont care about your needs and wants Asked for my steak cooked well and eggs cooked softeasy Steak came back raw and eggs were rubber they were cooked so well Waitress never came back to check on us The bus boys are always amazing though The orange juice is amazing and why we go back But this past time was the last Better Latin restaurants have opened up in the area do yourself the favor and go there,0
Its good I like,1
Great steaming bowls of pho The broth is delicious very umami  not sure if Im using it correctly I like to add a side of sauteed chinese broccoli My suggestion would be to stay away from the bun mi noodles which are less flavorful and seem to be a slight oversight relative to their pho The service is really efficient and very quick,1
Get and got the Cubano grilled corn plantains and homemade lime lemonade Also tried the fish burrito and quesotomatoavocado sandwich compliments of JJ We ate it outside the togo area because the wait was 2 hours Jenn thanks sis for planning this one  splitting the Cubano sandwich Wing it tastes the same as Habana Outpost except with more things Jimmy where are the pictures Enjoy karaoke Jennifer tell Jimmy to send me the pics will ya Thanks Sandy wasnt it all yummy Wolverine Karen  Dickson what next cheap drinks after dinner Note to restaurant owners When do you have deals on your 8 frozen mojitos,1
Their brunch many is ok Apparently their menu has printing errors so it misleads what the dish is really about Service is slow,1
Wow This was one of the most ridiculous restaurant experiences of my life I was pretty hungry and walking by with my lady so I stopped in since I had heard good things about the restaurant I should have known something was weird from the way they insisted on taking my coat off for me We ordered guacamole arepas empanadas oxtail and I forgot the main course because we didnt stay for it    The guacamole came a sad olive green clearly made during daytime prep and kept out in air during service Avocados oxidize quickly so I wasnt worried about it being rotten but no one wants to eat stuff that doesnt look fresh    After a confusing interval the oxtail dish came out Now I love oxtail and went eagerly poking around the plate to grab a piece of the most deliciously gelatinous meat on the cow I pulled out a strip of meat Strip I thought oxtail doesnt come in strips Oxtail is the meat that rings the vertebrae in a cows tail There just isnt any way a strip can come off that part of the animal I pointed this out to the waitress She took the piece of meat to the kitchen came back without it and told me that the chef had told her it was in fact oxtail I told her that it was impossible for that to be oxtail She asked me to tell the manager       The manager a strange man with hair seemingly painted on his head comes over and asks if there is a problem I start to tell him about the mystery meat and he cuts me off and says You dont like the oxtail Thats okay its an acquired taste No problem What else would you like I tell him that it wasnt oxtail in the dish and he says he eats the oxtail dish three times a week and loves it I explained to him that I had worked for many years in professional kitchens and had prepared oxtail in several different restaurants and that there was no way that the meat in the dish was oxtail He takes the plate back to the kitchen comes back to the table and says You know when I looked at that in the light I agree with you thats not oxtail   He offers to pack up the two sad looking apps that came in the interim so I can take them to go and comp the whole meal I left a tip for the server and got out before me and my lady ended up as oxtail   Here is the moral Dont treat your customers like idiots Sometimes they arent Sometimes you cant pass off mystery meat as oxtail Sometimes the best course of action is to say I am sorry we ran out and subbed some supermarket skirt steak for it We were hoping no one would notice The only thing they did right was not make me pay for it I left and laughed for blocks just amazed at the stones these people had serving me a dish that didnt have the promised ingredients in it then trying to repeatedly convince me that it was something it wasnt Hilarious,1
Their friend fish Excellent tasty and fresh And their portions are really large While the lobster bisque was very flavorful it definitely lacked what I would consider a decent amount of lobster But overall for the price I felt the quality and quantity was very good,1
My girlfriend NEEDED to have a salad and we were already nearby so I decided to try this place out I got the coconut curry tofu stir fry and she got a salad Portions were generous and both tasted great I really like the ordering process and customization The experience was enough for me to be like Yeah Im definitely going to be back to try out more things on the menu,1
Great price on dumplings if you want to get full without spending too much money The fried pork and chive dumplings are tasty Theyre not my favorite but theyre cheap I even bought the frozen pack of 50 to take home and cook on nights when I dont really have time to cook Its definitely a bargain,1
The crab soup dumplings here are better than at Joes ginger pretty good pho too Has enough seating for a comfortable casual meal with friends,1
Sadly I found this place my last week in BK  I hate moving back to the city and eating here just made it worse The falafel with stuffed artichoke is an awesome falafel rendition Great eggplant to go with it THe hash browns are awesome even though they charge for extra sauce i respect the hustle And come on green eggs an lamb Best name since some genius came up with Chairman Bao LOL,1
Everything about this place was just okay Nothing terrible but Im really not sure why everyones raving about how great this place is  The only thing that was above average was the waitstaff who were friendly and responsive We were seated all the way in the back dining room which was good bc we could actually hear each other over the din of the main bar area which gets loud However to note they have really horrible overhead lighting back there that doesnt do anyone  incl the food  any favors  That said the food itself was just ok Im guessing we mustve ordered the wrong items bc I just wasnt impressed at all Salads were just fair  your basic salads I had the caesar  my friend had the Tavern  neither of us were wowed Crab cakes were the tastiest item of the lot  two nicelysized and meaty cakes The pickled vegs were forgettable I dont think they were marinated long enough  they were just veggies in vinegar without spices or flavor  dont bother ordering and the fried artichoke hearts were ok  also forgetable and underseasoned  The strangest part of the dining experience was my drink I ordered a stoli vodka martini with a twist and after awhile once it warmed up  glass wasnt chilled I noticed it had a distinct smell  strange taste to it I still cant figure out what it was  my friend thought it was tequila but I thought it smelled like a hot pepper but without the spicy flavor The server agreed and said it smelled like one of their pickeled items that the bar uses I cant remember which now but couldnt figure out how it wouldve wound up in my glass She asked me if I wanted to order another drink but I didnt bother Overall meh,1
To me I got a very unclean vibe even though they use plastic plates and forks The tables just reek of dirty rags Food on the other hand was quite interesting I sat in a spot where it overlooks the kitchen and the chef was there at it pulling the noodles Quite entertaining seeing a block of noodle turn into delicate strands of noodle The noodle soups were great you can really taste the al dente and fresh noodles Im not too sure about their appetizers like dumplings or seaweed If youre around the neighborhood definitely come try their hand pulled noodles,1
This place rocks I came in for brunch with my bf and we ended up very happy Carlos  bartender took great care of us He is super nice and he makes awesome cocktails Food is tasty especially the pastry basket I really recommend this place,1
I tried Posto after reading the great reviews and left disappointed The plus of all this is that the pizza was good That was the only plus however The service was subpar After being seated and handed a menu by the host I waited 20 minutes for a waitress to show up at my table To make matters worse I watched her service two other parties who came in well after me before deciding to come over to my table Given that I had been sitting there for 20 minutes waiting for service I already knew what I wanted and placed my order immediately soup and a pizza After another 15 minutes the waitress finally returned to tell me that they were out of the soup Its soup Nothing complex here It shouldnt take 15 minutes to serve a bowl of soup let alone check to see that you actually have said soup At that point I opted just to eat my pizza which was tiny and leave still hungry Needless to say I didnt leave much of a tip which is very atypical for me,1
Barbecue spots can be very hit or miss Dinosaur Barbecue is definitely a HIT So lets talk food The ribs  YES PLEASE fall off the bone tender yummy goodness No extra slathering of sauce needed unless of course your a saucy kind of person The wings  OHHHHH YESSSSS the Hoisin sesame  WINNER The Honey BBQ  pretty darn good I tried the wango tango sauce in the jar from the store and wasnt a fan so I didnt bother to try the wings from Dino I will be back to try the other wing flavors you can bet your bottom dollar on that The sides  Heres where it can get a little miss The greens while they arent your grandmas down home southern greens they had good flavor Not a fan of the mac  cheese It was okay but nothing to sing praises about  I wouldnt order them again The fried rice was surprisingly good The mashed potatoes were okay All in all  I have all highfives  praises for Dino BBQ FYI if you are looking for intimacy or its a first date and conversation is importantdo NOT go there when football is on  especially a GiantsJets game LOUD,1
This place is amazing They have fresh food made daily for the price and speed of fast food How do they do it Im vegetarian and their veggie udon noodles are superb Their veggie burger is also unlike any other burger Ive ever had  truly a delight If you go for their sushi menu keep in mind their portions are rather large so you probably only need one roll here The spicy sauce that comes with the spicy cucumbers is delicious  but keep in mind this is pretty much just cucumbers and a dipping sauce so kindof not worth it Overall if you work or live in Chelsea and havent been to Kobeyaki yet  whats stopping you,1
I should probably say I really  really wanted to love this place had such high hopes for a super close reasonable fun Mexican restaurant Food was fine Thats it just fine Guacamole was extremely plentiful for a small size but you can tell it is not made to order My next observation I really hope the restaurant sees I got a margarita and when I received it there was salt on about 14 of the glass I kid you not It was not busy and there was no reason to not give an extra swirl to salt the whole glass Stuffed chicken breast was a large piece of chicken but seriously why even advertise the cream cheese and jalapeno It was minuscule highly disappointed as that was the reason I got the dish Tacos carne asada were good Service was fantastic absolutely lived the decor Overall I give it a even 5 out if 10 if only it had more cream cheesejalapeos and an actual salted glass I would have bumped it to a 7 and go back for more,1
After surviving vendor after vendor we finally found a resting spot it is rather hippy dippy do many vegan and gluten free cookiestreats Me and the hubs had the Gleaner OMG please do your tastebuds a favor and check this place out,0
The food at Stephanies was terrific My fiance and I went there last week for dinner and our meals were hot and tasty We had the fiocci and chicken marsalaThe decor is newly designed and has an old world charm of rustic Italy the owner even came by and asked us how our meal was All in all the service was great and the food even better This is a great little italian spot we found we will definitely be back again next week,0
Ive been there so many times but what happened last Friday made me decide I will never go there ever again We ordered a seafood pizza which I had before and really liked But this time the pizza was way too salty non of us can take a second piece As soon as I told the waiter he gave us a lecture on how seafood is supposed to be salty and it made me feel like a complete idiot by ordering the wrong pizza Even though they offered a discount in the end I dont think Ill ever go again The attitude is beyond imagination,1
My friend brought me here the first time was great with a group of folks because we sat at the only table available  it was communal Really small place We had to walk past people sitting at the bar AND people sitting at the walls who were waiting Literally touching everyone as we walk by them We had oysters octopus salad great mozzarella with prosciutto lobster ravioli and our own personal pastas I only really liked the octopus salad and prosciutto the appetizers didnt think the pastas were anything to shout about though Ive had much better pastas elsewhere The noise level was very loud though but I didnt care because the 5 of us contributed to the noise level too I liked the appetizers enough to go back a 2nd time this time with my bf However we were seated next to a very rowdy group of people and they were shouting and trying to talk over each other and us so we could hardly hear each other from across the communal table Also this time I realised that the servings were very small for the 915 price tag per plate Our bill totalled 100 for 5 plates and 2 glasses of wine The lasagna was only 4 mouthfuls That was alot of money for not so great pasta but excellent apps I think I probably wouldnt be going back there again in a while,1
Small place with a lot of character My boyfriend and I stopped by around 6pm on a weekday and were seated immediately The main portion of their menu is burgers My boyfriend and I split both the Alamo fried egg sweet onion rings bbq sauce pepperjack cheese and the Good Ol Boy cheddar cheese bacon sauted mushrooms The burgers were huge however I felt that all the toppings kind of got lost in the burger They didnt add much to the meal The meat itself was VERY juicy and cooked perfectly I almost wish I got a plain ol burger here Fries were good Burgers are pricey at around 15 Very expensive especially for the area,1
I loved their Japanese Katsu fried pork chop with curry on rice Their sauce is not spicy at all but full with favorite and Its only 12 bucks I try their mix drink with peach it was really tasty too I think its a great place if you want to get a quick dinner for cheap by mid town,1
This bar was just okay The drinks were great as was the venue but the people who came to the bar were weirdos My best friend and I came on a Saturday night hoping to find some cute guys or fun people to talk towe found NEITHER Needless to say we only stayed about 20 minutes Wont be back any time soon,1
De Mole is HANDS DOWN my FAVORITE restaurant of all time I rarely write reviews but I am feeling emotional today since we are moving out of the neighborhood next month and I wont be able to order takeout from this fabulous place anymore Everything about this restaurant is wonderful  amazing food great service nice ambiance and very affordable The past year this place has been a lifesaver for me since I have a 12 month old that is a picky eater but she LOVES the guacamole and black beans from this restaurant What will we do when we move Boo hoo Anyway I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves authentic Mexican cuisine We will be coming back occasionally for sure Thank you De Mole xx,1
Worth the wait though I opted for takeout The heroes take longer to make than the other dishes You really cant go wrong with any combination of meats or sauces everything is very flavorful,1
The service was amazing Food was beyond amazing I had a burrata mozzarella cheese with avocadotomato It was soft and so good And I also had Tordelli Bolognese which was rich and flavorful I recommend this place but just let you know it is lil pricy place,1
The review here say it all mostly For an Italian place I would expect better espresso though,1
Now that Miss Rachel opened up her cafe I couldnt be more thrilled This place is adorable Even though her BBQ sandwich has always been my favorite recently Ive been addicted to her tofu scrambler platter It comes with a big biscuit potatoes and fruit Its the perfect way to start off a weekend morning And everything is priced right Im so sick of paying extra for seitan and tofu options Brunch for 2 for 20 Awesome Tip Its BYOB,1
The Chef Gila makes it feel as if you are home eating a home cooked meal The food is authentic seasoned well and are complemented by the natural drinks and teas prepared while you wait The tahini is homemade and her version of French Toast is insanely good A must try,0
Superb selection of food Six plates are great for two people You MUST try the infamous bacon doughnuts I believe the menu is seasonal so what is on their website may not reflect what they are currently serving at least in my case I should have ordered everything on the menu because the chef has a way of incorporating unconventional ingredients ie StrawberryCinnamon Baby Back Ribs that send your taste buds on a journey,1
Mmmm mmm mmm Delicious and cozy atmosphere Ive been here for regular dinner and for the special chefs tasting menu Its always been wonderful The garden is very romantic as there is only 1 table and its just for 2 You probably have to arrive early to get it The tasting menu was so good we ate and drank for 3 straight hours and the chef spoke with us frequently explaining what he was preparing where the meats were from and how the beer you can also do a wine pairing cpmlimented the particular dish I cant wait to go back,1
First time here dining in lovely and quaint Old Wethersfield and I feel lucky to have stopped in here Very nice spot great old wood interior and very decent outside dining space We ate outside on a great autumn day The noise in low and the owners are savvy enough to play the music low enough to hear and not to interrupt conversation The Caesar salad came with diced tomatoes and capers that may be mentioned in the menu and the dressing is fabulous The burgers and generous and cooked to perfection I was very impressed You may know how it is when you crave a burger and it comes out perfect We also have the calamari appetizer which was fantastic with hot peppers Its my favorite way to have it and again I was not disappointment I would absolutely come back here and would look forward to trying it for dinner some time,1
Props for being out there in freezing weather This place is like an institution Been 3 years since I last came Now I have a kid Feels a little soup Naziish but didnt have any probs the 10 big daddy was Delish They didnt skimp on the meat I have been cutting down on rice as Ive been getting overly sleepy on it Whatever you do do NOT park at C town There are signs and its not fair to the people shopping there Anyways got that over yellow rice with red and white sauce My little one loved it too without the red of course The other people after me were lackadaisical about where to stand in line and order The big dude taking orders was NOT cool w that Also pay the guy at the end on the right near the passengers window Was just as good as I remembered it Plus it is right by the Xmas tree and wreath sellers so it was kinda nice The wreaths are 1520 BTW,1
Bianca is a great little find Its tiny but you never feel cramped or overwhelmed I went on a Saturday night at about 8 and only waited for about 20 minutes The decorations are really cuteyou sort of feel like youre sitting at your aunts nicely decorated home The food was also very good I got the tagliolini dish with clams mussels and shrimp My friend got the gnocchi which looked delicious Ill definitely be back here sometime soon,1
I came for brunchlunch and will definitely be back again Ive been to Grey Dogs Coffee in Union Square many times before and always loved the food  I was happy to have a consistent experience here at the Chelsea location I was surprised that it was not too crowded during the weekend at noon but definitely no complaints on that we got to sit at one of the high top tables outside and people watch so it was perfect The menu is extensive and its hard to pick from all the delicious choices Most recently I had the Roasted Turkey Brie Plum Tomato  Raspberry Mustard sandwich on cranberry walnut bread They do a great job with creating flavorful and healthy options The food is very fresh and the portion size is remarkably big The staff was also really friendly and accommodating which made the overall experience that much better,1
Regulator is not a direct replacement for the meter which is a nice bonus I have one in my bathroom  The meter is designed to be used with a positive voltage so that it doesnt accidentally turn on when using a voltagecontrolled light  I find that most people dont realize that this meter will turn off,0
Last time I was in the Pure Fare restaurant I mentioned to the cashier that I wished the place was closer to my office in University City She let me know that they were opening a food truck hopefully in September I got the news last week from the U City facebook feed that they were indeed opening on Wednesday I made it out here on Friday at 12 just before a bit of a rush of people They serve the same salads and sandwiches premade and ready to go I liked that the salad dressing was on the side because I was picking up two salads to share for dinner later that night The salad with zucchini noodles edamame bell peppers and grape tomatoes was delightful I think it was the salad dressing a fresh tasting light lemony dressing was what made it really special The second salad was a bed of arugula with fresh beets goat cheese and red onions I had buyers remorse at first when I brought that one home because I usually cant hang with the peppery arugula I was surprised that I loved this salad as well Again the dressing was what made the arugula bearable The goat cheese was a little bland but perhaps it is a lower fat version than what Im used to Id love to give them five stars but I think theyre still working out some food truck basics If youre going to sell from a food truck please charge an amount that is divisible by a quarter My total bill came to 1512 and I had to dig for change at the bottom of my purse I will be back Probably twice a week because its a 5 minute walk away hooray,1
The Plaki Thats all you need to know Its the thickest most succulent moist chunk of sea bass your mouth will ever have the pleasure of indulging in Not only does the fish itself exude tenderness and flakiness beyond all imagination but the skin is as crisp as a Pringle Its sopped in a tomato broth complete with whole stewed tomatoes accompanied by other green vegetables that are equally soft and equally amazing Its also kind of huge so you could probably share it with an equally ravenous guest provided you get an appetizer or two to fill Although the complimentary hummus and bread might be enough  go ahead indulge The hummus is creamy and spotted with olives lending just enough of that Mediterranean flavor to make you year for an ocean sunsetand to extend an olive branch to your arch nemesisalmost The Estia chips are also a pleasure the super thin fried zucchini and eggplant chips are stacked beautifully taste wonderfully and are served with a creamy taziki dip thats not over powered by dill,1
Such a fun gift thats what I wanted We love this toy,0
I think Genos is loosing the battle with Pats So sad thought,0
the corn is amazing  Something I had never tried before and didnt expect to taste so great Fish tacos are great too as are the margaritas Would be great if they could sell singular tacos instead of having to buy the whole plate with rice and beans Also the staff arent the friendliest hence the 4 stars,1
Upon coming across this magnificent gem of a bar I was treated with the up most respect and genuine gentility that one can imagine I was very impressed by the bartenders timely replenishment of our unlimited drinks Not only did this place provide great service but the brunch specials like pulled pork Benedict and stuffed French toast is amazing The establishment deserves 4 stars but I believe the bartender  roger I think  deserves 10,1
I have a bone to pick with you Mario Batali Dont say you participate in meatless Mondays if it means you just take everything on the regular menu and copy it to another menu with a warning about how we need to consume less meat First off carnivores dont care what you have to say Second off us vegetarians already know this I could have easily done the work myself by looking at the regular menu and figuring out what didnt have meat And here I thought you were sympathetic to our omnivore needs Oh and lay off the pepper Damn Apparently the veal was good though Explains a lot,1
Love the atmosphere wine and pizza Owner is a doll and the staff is attentive Dont pass this by,1
When I was a young guido living in Bloomfield I loved loitering on Broad st There was so much ish to doliftin mad weights at World of Fitness while droolin from the smell of McDonalds next to it chowin down on Gencarellis gahnolis across the street chillin with mah asian peeps at Brookside Thai eatin pizza at Parkside and Vinnies with mah guidette gfsand gettin ripped at Obals Inn The deelish inexpensive ribs are the draw but hangin and bullshittin with the elderly Bloomfield residentsthat was just gold Every time I came here I heard this line from the bornnraisedoldasspatrons kid when I grew up here there were no blacks hispanics and noneayou gooksWTF Im Asitalian I love those vietnam vets,1
Absolutely delicious food If you are looking for a hole in the wall with authentic Mexican food that tastes great then this is it  Driving to the place would worry most because the area is definitely not upscale The restaurant is a plain rectangular corner building with a small sign over the door The employees are very personable unlike most Mexican restaurants the employees spoke and understood English very well which actually gave me a wrong first impression thinking if they speak English this well they cant make good Mexican food That impression was as wrong as it was prejudiced  They have a vast menu Tacos with every filling you could imagine except ground beef which disappointed my wife only up until she took the first taste of her Chorizo She found the Chorizo to be perfect The restaurant is only slightly bigger than the space needed for the kitchen so the dine in area is nearly inside the kitchen You could watch them make your meal from the table and my wife noticed everything was prepared fresh as needed The wait time from ordering to food on the table was acceptable I could be wrong but I think the owners live in an apartment right off the corner of the restaurant because as we waited I witnessed a woman come out make something to eat then brought it back into the apartment I am under the impression this is what a restaurant in Mexico would be like There was no fancy decor no Mexican blankets no Mariachi singers no morracas or any of that stuff you see in a commercialized place I received excellent food at a decent price with good service I would definitely go back again Dont be turned off by location or lack of the commercialized look If you are in the mood for great Mexican food dont miss this place Just remember to bring cash,0
I love this place My boyfriend and I come here at least once a week for brunch which is AMAZING Nothing is too greasy or anything other than fresh tasting Free refills on coffee plus good service and no waiting for seats is a HUGE plus Great alternative to Northeast Kingdom,1
AMAZING EVERY TIME A wonderful concept My favorite restaurant in NYC when dining with friends I highly recommend the Chefs Feast I have tried everything and always leave with a big smile and a very happy tummy This is one Feast you will never want to end,0
Im not saying anything that hasnt been said a hundred times before but this place is awesome I just wish it was open later so I could eat dinner there too when Im in town because there are so many options This is a must anytime I am in the area It can get crowded at lunch so be prepared to wait in line for some of the best stuff,1
It was my first time here and I ordered yellow Dahl and rice after asking if it was spicy The guy told me it wasnt it was mild It comes and I try it I was with 3 other people and when he came back to deliver another persons food I politely told him the soup was spicer than I wouldve liked and asked him for a piece of bread His answer was that is what the rice is for I found that incredibly rude He didnt even apologize I was shocked at his response and he just walked away Then another employee asked us if we were almost ready to leave after our plates were taken away because some other people wanted our table Ill take my business elsewhere and would suggest you go anywhere else Im also not sure why the price is only  on here it was almost 9 for guacamole with chips and about 7 for a bowl of soup Not impressed with the food quality for that price The employees need a lesson in customer service hands down,1
This deli has the most bangn pho sandwich I ever hadextremely flavorful and just makes me crave for it again writing this review I had the pho 1 and 2 beforecant go wrong with either one If you re a beef type go 1 and if chicken go 2 Your expectations for it wont be disappointed I even seen a drunk lady coming here late at night to grab a sandwicheven they know whats goodlol,1
I went to this restaurant based on the overwhelmingly great reviews on Yelp How could I not try it Maybe I ordered poorly and I did go on Monday night but I was not impressed with the food given what we were paying The bread was chewy definitely a day old baguette The beet salad was also prefabbed the day before as it came out and everything on the plate was the same cold temperature from beets to salad to salad dressing the beets were entirely limp either overcooked and refrigerated or simply canned and refrigerated  I had the signature duck breast dish which was okay definitely overcooked for medium rare but okay nonetheless presentation was lackluster The side including a pinch of chopped tomatoes sitting forlornly at the edge of the plate and a sweet potato side that tasted good it was sweet potato after all but was also prefabbed as it was a square carved out of some larger casserole and placed oddly at another edge of the plate the same held true with the meringue for dessert a square carved out from a larger pan I simply had never seen a meringue that was not individualized the caramelized sugar on top was also burnt this place seems to compensate for its small kitchen by premaking most of their meals in industrialized portions then repackaging them for individual consumers does noone else notice this the service although other people seem to love it consisted of one woman who was very involved with the computer and could not find time for customers at one point she told me she would be right with me then sat at the computer for 10 minutes this place is small and there is no way she could have possibly forgotten i was about two feet away i also have to say i thought the menu was tacky at one point it declared that an entree was greasy in all caps as though preemptive declarations are somehow a solution to poor quality entrees why not also say that the duck is going to be overcooked in all caps as well at least i would have been prepared In the end I am not from the area and feel like these stellar reviews must come from people who are prolific on yelp dont mind overpaying for everything and perhaps dont get outside of the lousy service typical of other lower manhattan establishments other restaurants definitely offer better service and better food at that price,0
Works well enough for what I use it for as a test server Im tempted to get something else similar perhaps a NUC with Core i5 instead for a family member It works really well is quiet and you can put it anywhere as long as it has ventilation,1
My favorite place for pho in Vermont The place is no frills but the staff are friendly and the soup is amazing I live a 5 minute walk from there and get soup at least once a week This place rocks when you are feeling sick from coldflu Pho with a bunch of sriracha will save the day,0
After researching a lot of Cuban spots in the city I decided to go ahead and make a reservation for 10 people this past Saturday night at Cuba for my birthday Our drinks the white sangria were fabulous and there was a great live band performing while we waited for our food The ambience of the restaurant and bar area was great and the dcor and setup is really quaint and cozy For food we each ordered our own appetizers as well as entrees and we tried to all get different dishes so that we could sample a lot of different things on the menu Every dish we ordered was better than the next The spinach and manchego cheese empanadas were so delicious I cant stop dreaming about them All of my friends were so beyond happy with their meals portions were big and so reasonable priced and now were all trying to figure out when we can all get together for round 2 at Cuba  The only reason I did not give this restaurant 5 stars is based solely on their incredibly rude cigar roller According to the restaurant staff cigars are complimentary as long as you eat here which we all did and when we were leaving and I went to go claim our cigars the nasty cigar roller said to me as I asked for them YOU KNOW HAVE TO TIP ME RIGHT Since when do you HAVE to tip someone I had all intentions on tipping this guy and he had the nerve to say that to me before he even handed me my cigars Meanwhile I didnt even ask for 10 cigars which I should have and only took 5 Cuba my experience was wonderful except for that situation Find a new cigar roller his horrible attitude and demeanor is going to be the reason people dont come back,1
I have to thank Karen S For her review Totally helped me out when I came here I was looking through their menu and couldnt decide what I wanted then I saw them walk by with a huge piece of Tiramisu and I remembered her review The tiramisu is AHMAZINGGG I totally recommend a double shot cappuccino  tiramisu You cant go wrong As everyone else stated the cappuccino is thick creamy  delicious The service was great as well and customer service is huge to me The hostess took my name so she could call me when my table was ready After I was seated and eating she would pass by periodically asking Will is everything good so far I went around 230 or 3pm and it was pretty packed It might be better to go earlier to avoid the crowd I will definitely return for that Tiramisu,1
After listening this Covent Garden concert I thought it was a great show and I was disappointedI had to watch the entire concert as there was a great deal of confusion between the band and the audience Some of the songs are really cool some are not I felt a bit cheated because I didnt get to see the whole thingI also felt a bit cheated because I didnt get to hear any of the songs that are on the dvd I wanted to know where the songs are but I couldntOverall this is a great concert It is a great concert but its not one you want to missIm sure Ill watch it again and againIf you like a good concert this is one you should definitely seeGreat showI saw this film in the theater a few years ago and was excited to see it  I was disappointed in this film  It is about a man who while on the run from his own demons has to take care of his wife and son  He tries to find a way to keep them together but his efforts are all over the place  When he does he is caught by a murderer who has a son  He has to find his way out of his,0
Recently went for brunch The duck hash special was tiny and had very little duck in it The pancakes were not a large portion either Both dishes were ok but not great or flavorful and very overpriced Doubt we will be coming back for a while,1
If I could give ten stars I would  I spent a significant amount of time in Sicily and the pizza antipasti cannoli etc all taste like the real deal  However I havent tried Lombardis yetso Ill update as necessary in the future,1
ohhhhhhhhh yes i always thought this place was a random sketchy bar maybe because i only ever walked by it in the dark and under the influence with a bloody mary served round the clock and a dirty martini made with pickled green tomatoes this place can do no wrong awesome food especially the chips dreaming of them right now they pour fondue on topFONDUE so some chips are still crunchy while others are deliciously soggy and soaked with yummylicious cheese pork chop  good photo booth  fun waitress  nice yay,1
One of the best Italian Hot Dogs you can get short of making your own Wanted one tonight and called to see what time they close It is 9 pm on a Friday night and the dude said they are already closed How disappointing One of those things you crave once you have had one I think I will try the pizza next time because according to a review it has a lot of cheese,1
I came here for dinner on a Friday night  and the place was packed with an approximate half an hour wait Cold soba nicely complements a warm almost hot Spring night I had a light meal with the avocado tuna tartare to start followed by the tororo soba The soba was fresh and cool  just the way I liked it I eyed and ulimately passed on the dessert menu but going back would probably try the milk pudding with strawberry I really liked the lighting and the lights  they were authentically pretty,1
